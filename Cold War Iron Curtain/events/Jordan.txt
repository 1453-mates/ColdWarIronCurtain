Already crabs are being tried in Jordanian courts and anyone suspected on harboring fugitive crabs will be tried as well. When a government spokesman was asked for reasoning on why crabs are considered as a threat to national security he simply stated that it was an order from Talal and should thus not be taken into question. All around Jordan people are united in confusion and many speculate that this might just be the beginning of Talal's strange tendencies....."
