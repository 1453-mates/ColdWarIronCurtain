Although pockets of resistance still exist in the Carpathians, the bulk of the nationalist paramilitary group has officially been crushed under the boot of the Red Army, and the NKVD is working to root out what little is left.\n\n §RInsurgency Level: [UIA_INS_TIER]§\n\n Current Strength [?ukranian_insurgency|R]%"
