 UIA_insurgency_options.1.d:0 "One of our Special Domestic Agents has successfully infiltrated the UIA and the informational gain is incredible. We have gained an unprecedented amount of data and a network of confidential informants who will aid our fight against the Ukrainian insurgency. Already, our network has discovered countless supply depots and is capable of dismantling countless operations, severely weakening the capability of the UIA to do damage against our nation.\nThis success will have profoundly positive implications and protect our nation."
 UIA_insurgency_options.2.d:0 "Following the failure of our Special Domestic Agent`s attempt to infiltrate the UIA, the UIA has patched several vulnerable points in their operations, improved their vetting process, and become more resilient as a whole. Additionally, although our agent resisted interrogation, they were able to learn more about us from his actions and in the coming days, may attempt to use these techniques against lower level targets such as police stations and garrisons.\nThis failure is a stain on our record and will have notable consequences."
 UIA_insurgency_options.3.d:0 "A hard crackdown on the UIA`s operations has resulted in astounding success. Our police forces were more than prepared to take down the enemy and caught them off guard. We have seized countless explosives, equipment, and killed many UIA operatives. Additionally, the raid has granted us large quantities of intel as they failed to destroy it in time.\nThis success will weaken their future operations and lower their ferocity."
 UIA_insurgency_options.4.d:0 "The UIA knew we were coming. They either evacuated their facilities leaving firetraps set to detonate when the police got deep inside, or established ambushes against our police. Not only has this resulted in a severe failure, but the enemy even mounted counterattacks against our police stations and launch opportunistic supply grab attacks while our officers were busy or dead. The UIA is now vastly more well armed and capable of future attacks in the area. For the time being, we have sent in police reinforcements from nearby areas and even assigned soldiers to patrols to bolster the now weakened Soviet forces.\nThis failure will weaken our attempts to fight them in the area and likely increase their ferocity."
 UIA_insurgency_options.5.d:0 "After several recon passes and countless hours of preparation, we finally launched our bombing strikes against remote UIA facilities. From apricot farms to beachside modern houses, their militia`s facilities were greatly weakened. Our strikes leveled training facilities, made opportunistic runs against supply convoys, destroyed staging areas, and generally knocked out remote bases. The UIA is now vastly weaker and the lack of these remote facilities will disconnect their network of cells operating between cities.\nThe enemy will now be less capable of making attacks and will be less aggressive in the future."
 UIA_insurgency_options.6.d:0 "Not only was our intel incorrect, not only did we destroy countless non-targets, but we actually somehow managed to destroy some of our own nation`s assets. Guard posts and our own army`s supply trains were ravaged by the misdirection. From what our intel director says, the enemy had been feeding our confidential informants misinformation. In the future we may need to coordinate better with the army to ensure that if we do fail, it will not result in friendly fire.\nThis failure will weaken the army`s capability to fight the insurgency and prevent attacks, making them more aggressive."
 UIA_insurgency_options.10.d:0 "The Red Army has proudly announced the complete annihilation of the UIA (Ukranian Insurgent Army). After years of fighting, the UIA has been utterly destroyed after a final strike against the remnants of the UIA wiped out the fleeing, remaining leader and killed off what few assets they have left. So many militant Ukranian independence supports died that the UIA is unlikely to be able to resurge.\nIn a press conference the head of Pravada, the Soviet Union's state media company, proudly announced that this should stand as a warning against all those who stand against the workers of the Soviet Union and its people.\nUkranian loyalists who aided in the fight as well as countless unnamed confidential Special Domestic Agents will be rewarded for their sacrifice and service to the Soviet Union."
 UIA_insurgency_options.11.d:0 "Following a brutal guerilla war and the destruction of critical Red Army airbases, the UIA (Ukranian Insurgent Army) has proudly announced that after years of fighting, Ukraine is free. The UIA has established an independent government and driven out all foreign officials and loyalist elements from the area. Thousands of Ukranian nationalists have lined the streets to celebrate the founding of an independent nation.\nIn a press conference, the leaders of the insurgency have declared that this should serve as an example to all revolutionaries across all countries that no nation is too big or too powerful to be resisted and that all who seek independence from the Tyranny of their rulers should stand up and fight.\nUkranian loyalists and KGB Special Domestic Agents have been brutally executed and key loyalists in the UIA will be rewarded by the group at large."

 kenya.1.d:0 "Oh sweet Chief, how we loved you so! Last night, the Commonwealth lost one of its most loyal and charismatic figures in East Africa. Just outside of Nairobi the beloved chief was being chauffeured when three gunmen shot through the car, killing Waruhiu instantly. Waruhiu was a true advocate for British colonial rule, an outspoken critic of independence groups and various indigenous people vying for unnecessary autonomy. These murderers are being referred to as Mau Mau, our secretaries are linking this assassination with multiple other murders and acts of violence towards white settlers in the colony and protectorate of Kenya."
 
 KLFA_insurgency_options.1.d:0 "Some of our Special Domestic Agents who have relatives who work in agriculture managed to infiltrate Mau Mau undetected. They will now be able to acquire lots of information from within` the organization mostly due to family trust. We will be able to track enemy movements and prepare to counter major operations with this gain. The SDAs, however, expect their family members to be pardoned after the insurgency is dealt with in return.\nThis success will have profoundly positive implications and protect our nation"
 KLFA_insurgency_options.2.d:0 "Our Special Domestic Agents attempted to get into Mau Mau through family members who work in agriculture, but it backfired horribly. The SDAs trusted their family members too much and let them know they were agents and were captured and interrogated or killed. Additionally, some agents have even chosen family over country and given them information on our counter insurgency operations.\nThis failure is a stain on our record and will have notable consequences."
 
 KLFA_insurgency_options.3.d:0 "A series of rural raids on towns housing land army insurgents has resulted in a resounding success. Hundreds of enemy insurgents lie dead in their homes and their assets have been seized by the state. We have taken their weapons and equipment for ourselves and any stolen goods they have are now forfeit. The auctioning of the now deceased insurgents will also bring in a sizable level of income, most of which will likely go to executive incentives.\nThis success will weaken their future operations and lower their ferocity."
 KLFA_insurgency_options.4.d:0 "An attempt to raid enemy locations in rural towns using police assets has backfired. Many local police agencies have close ties with the enemy and chose this opportunity to backstab loyalist officers. There are now countless small towns and villages that are fully controlled by enemy insurgents and out of the hands of government control. Additionally, the enemy now controls a larger stockpile of weapons and arms from the traitorous police stations.\nThis failure will weaken our attempts to fight them in the area and likely increase their ferocity."
 
 KLFA_insurgency_options.5.d:0 "Light jet firebombers have managed to destroy numerous known insurgent staging and training areas in the wilderness. In addition to scaring potential trainees, these bombings have caused a brain drain within` Mau Mau as numerous instructors have been killed resulting in a shortage of capable trainers within` Mau Mau`s ranks. A combination of the brain drain and scare effects will likely prevent the enemy from being able to maintain intensity in their attacks.\nThe enemy will now be less capable of making attacks and will be less aggressive in the future."
 KLFA_insurgency_options.6.d:0 "Our light jets targeted decoy locations rather than our intended targets. The enemy launched AA ambushes against our planes and took them down while they were targeting the cheap decoys. Losing these jets in the AO will allow the enemy to be more bold and take the opportunity to become more aggressive and launch attacks that could normally be prevented by air support.\nThis failure will weaken the army`s capability to fight the insurgency and prevent attacks, making them more aggressive."
 
 KLFA_insurgency_options.10.d:0 "\nAfter years of fighting, Mau Mau has been suppressed and what few supporters they have left are too afraid to rise again. The Kenyan rebellion, which desired an end to colonial rule, was suppressed by colonial forces and officially brought to an end with the capture of its leader, Field Marshal Stanley Mathenge.\nThe British colonial officials have released a statement that with the end of the rebellion, Kenya will likely remain under British rule for a very long period of time. Whether or not this is true remains to be seen as many of Kenya`s denizens still have serious problems with colonial policy and it may boil over in the future.\nRegardless, Mau Mau has been destroyed and the only thing that remains certain about the future is that they will not be a part of it."
 KLFA_insurgency_options.11.d:0 "After years of fighting, Mau Mau has successfully toppled British colonial rule and achieved their goals. The Kenyan rebellion, which desires to end colonial rule, has successfully driven out colonial loyalists and achieved their goals. Colonial garrisons were razed, British loyalists were expelled or killed, and the land armies of Mau Mau are returning to their farms.\nThe leader of Mau Mau, Field Marshal Stanley Mathenge, has announced in a press conference that this will bring on a new era of African independence from colonial oppression and promises to give Kenya “all that it deserves and was denied”.\nMau Mau`s success will mark a new chapter in Kenyan history and deliver a blow to Great Britain`s empire."

 UPC_insurgency_options.0.d:0 "The Union des Populations du Cameroun (UPC) published its declaration of independence, pro-independence riots broke out in Douala and Yaounde. Although the French colonial authorities suppressed the riots and banned the UPC, the UPC launched an armed struggle against the French. This escalation into armed resistance sees the end of over six years of tension between the UPC and French colonial authorities. French officials had sought to curtail UPC influence by suppressing voting and rejecting efforts to negotiate a peaceful transition for independence, but these tactics only pushed the UPC to war. For the UPC, despite having a leadership of men deeply connected to French culture and education, under Um Nyobe they have engaged in a more revolutionary path. This has alienated other Cameroonian elites who still look to France and reject the UPC`s call for resistance. They prefer to achieve independence within the colonial system."
 UPC_insurgency_options.10.d:0 "\nThe French military`s campaign of establishing pacification zones and breaking up the Union des Populations du Cameroun (UPC) rebels pushed the fighting to the west among the Bamileke. The first Cameroon Pacification Zone saw the population put under heavy surveillance, within designated camps. These efforts saw many UPC leaders captured and killed but similar efforts in the west did not completely succeed. France`s decision to grant Cameroon independence did not end the conflict as the UPC continued to resist what it saw as a French puppet state from its bases in the west. The new Cameroon government continued to rely on French military support as it continued a brutal counter-insurgency campaign that laid waste to many Bamileke villages. The recent assassination of another senior rebel leader seemingly broke the back of resistance as Cameroon appears to have finally defeated the rebels."
 UPC_insurgency_options.11.d:0 "The French and their Cameroonian allies today accepted the independence of Bamilekia. What had originally started off as an anti-colonial struggle transformed into the fight for the independence of the Bamileke people. The French and Cameroonians both engaged in a policy of establishing pacification zones to control and uproot the rebels. This effort in Bamileke areas of Cameroon succeeded in isolating the Union des Populations du Cameroun (UPC) fighters from the rest of Cameroon but kept them closely connected to the local Bamileke population. An alliance with the fighters and Bamileke elites ensured French and their Cameroonian allies` efforts in defeating the UPC were unsuccessful. Many among the Bamileke appear satisfied with their new nation and endorse a policy of reconstruction and socialism. However, there are also some elements who see Bamilekia as the legitimate government of Cameroon and desire to continue the struggle once the nation rebuilds itself."
