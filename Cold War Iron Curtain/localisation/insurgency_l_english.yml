 uia_decisions_desc:0 "£UIA_Icon The Ukranian Insurgent Army\nFounded in 1942, the Ukrayinska Povstanska Armiya (UPA) fought against the Nazi invasion, the Soviet counterattack into Ukrainian lands, and even found itself in bloody engagements against the Polish Underground State, all in attempts to create an independent and German-aligned Ukrainian state. Although pockets of resistance still exist in the Carpathians, the bulk of the nationalist paramilitary group has officially been crushed under the boot of the Red Army, and the NKVD is working to root out what little is left.\n\n Current Strength: [?ukranian_insurgency|R]%\n Currently Selected State: [?root.current_country_state_decision.GetName]"

 UIA_insurgency_options.1.d:0 "One of our Special Domestic Agents has successfully infiltrated the UIA and the informational gain is incredible. We have gained an unprecedented amount of data and a network of confidential informants who will aid our fight against the Ukrainian insurgency. Already, our network has discovered countless supply depots and is capable of dismantling countless operations, severely weakening the capability of the UIA to do damage against our nation.\nThis success will have profoundly positive implications and protect our nation."
 UIA_insurgency_options.2.d:0 "Following the failure of our Special Domestic Agent’s attempt to infiltrate the UIA, the UIA has patched several vulnerable points in their operations, improved their vetting process, and become more resilient as a whole. Additionally, although our agent resisted interrogation, they were able to learn more about us from his actions and in the coming days, may attempt to use these techniques against lower level targets such as police stations and garrisons.\nThis failure is a stain on our record and will have notable consequences."
 UIA_insurgency_options.3.d:0 "A hard crackdown on the UIA’s operations has resulted in astounding success. Our police forces were more than prepared to take down the enemy and caught them off guard. We have seized countless explosives, equipment, and killed many UIA operatives. Additionally, the raid has granted us large quantities of intel as they failed to destroy it in time.\nThis success will weaken their future operations and lower their ferocity."
 UIA_insurgency_options.4.d:0 "The UIA knew we were coming. They either evacuated their facilities leaving firetraps set to detonate when the police got deep inside, or established ambushes against our police. Not only has this resulted in a severe failure, but the enemy even mounted counterattacks against our police stations and launch opportunistic supply grab attacks while our officers were busy or dead. The UIA is now vastly more well armed and capable of future attacks in the area. For the time being, we have sent in police reinforcements from nearby areas and even assigned soldiers to patrols to bolster the now weakened Soviet forces.\nThis failure will weaken our attempts to fight them in the area and likely increase their ferocity."
 UIA_insurgency_options.5.d:0 "After several recon passes and countless hours of preparation, we finally launched our bombing strikes against remote UIA facilities. From apricot farms to beachside modern houses, their militia’s facilities were greatly weakened. Our strikes leveled training facilities, made opportunistic runs against supply convoys, destroyed staging areas, and generally knocked out remote bases. The UIA is now vastly weaker and the lack of these remote facilities will disconnect their network of cells operating between cities.\nThe enemy will now be less capable of making attacks and will be less aggressive in the future."
 UIA_insurgency_options.6.d:0 "Not only was our intel incorrect, not only did we destroy countless non-targets, but we actually somehow managed to destroy some of our own nation’s assets. Guard posts and our own army’s supply trains were ravaged by the misdirection. From what our intel director says, the enemy had been feeding our confidential informants misinformation. In the future we may need to coordinate better with the army to ensure that if we do fail, it will not result in friendly fire.\nThis failure will weaken the army’s capability to fight the insurgency and prevent attacks, making them more aggressive."
 UIA_insurgency_options.10.d:0 "The Red Army has proudly announced the complete annihilation of the UIA (Ukranian Insurgent Army). After years of fighting, the UIA has been utterly destroyed after a final strike against the remnants of the UIA wiped out the fleeing, remaining leader and killed off what few assets they have left. So many militant Ukranian independence supports died that the UIA is unlikely to be able to resurge.\nIn a press conference the head of Pravada, the Soviet Union's state media company, proudly announced that this should stand as a warning against all those who stand against the workers of the Soviet Union and its people.\nUkranian loyalists who aided in the fight as well as countless unnamed confidential Special Domestic Agents will be rewarded for their sacrifice and service to the Soviet Union."
 UIA_insurgency_options.11.d:0 "Following a brutal guerilla war and the destruction of critical Red Army airbases, the UIA (Ukranian Insurgent Army) has proudly announced that after years of fighting, Ukraine is free. The UIA has established an independent government and driven out all foreign officials and loyalist elements from the area. Thousands of Ukranian nationalists have lined the streets to celebrate the founding of an independent nation.\nIn a press conference, the leaders of the insurgency have declared that this should serve as an example to all revolutionaries across all countries that no nation is too big or too powerful to be resisted and that all who seek independence from the Tyranny of their rulers should stand up and fight.\nUkranian loyalists and KGB Special Domestic Agents have been brutally executed and key loyalists in the UIA will be rewarded by the group at large."
