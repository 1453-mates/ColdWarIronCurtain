EGY_1973.1.t “Egypt Launches Operation Badr”
EGY_1973.1.d “After months of preparation, our armed forces are ready to launch Operation Badr. Operation Badr will allow our forces to breakthrough Zionist formations and penetrate the Sinai. The mistakes of previous conflicts will not be repeated. This time the war will be on our terms and we are prepared to drive through the enemy. The Zionists have grown complacent and many of their forces are on leave for Yom Kippur.  We are attacking in Ramadan, a most auspicious month which will only strengthen the belief of our soldiers on the front.”
EGY_1973.1.a “So it begins...”

EGY_1973.2.t “The Sinai is Ours!” 
EGY_1973.2.d “The Zionists have long proclaimed the Sinai as an unbreakable fortress but today our forces have not only breached their walls but now control the Sinai. Sinai is an arm of the Egyptian nation and its return to our just control inspires the nation. Millions across Egypt welcome the news and the morale of our forces on the front is overflowing. The decision facing our government and military is whether to offer a cease fire or press on. Since we have secured the Sinai, sovereign Egyptian land, we can fortify our positions and offer a ceasefire from a position of strength. However, doing so will risk alienating our Arab brothers who will want us to push on toward Jerusalem. Considering how well our forces are driving the enemy back, pressing on to end the Zionist threat once and for all is also an option. Achieving total victory would allow us to determine the future of the region but the resistance can be expected to intensify, and we risk wearing down our own forces. 
EGY_1973.2.a “Offer a ceasefire”
EGY_1973.2.b “Let us complete our conquest!”

EGY_1973.3.t “More Gains in Palestine!”
EGY_1973.3.d “From the Sinai, our troops have continued to press on into the Zionist territory, liberating swaths of Arab lands in Palestine. The Zionists continue to resist our forces, but our commanders have quietly expressed their own surprise at the success of our forces. However, as the military advances, it is moving further away from supply lines and there is a worry of over-extension from senior commanders. It must now be decided whether we declare a ceasefire and negotiate with the Sinai and key parts of Palestine under our control, or if we should continue to press for a final victory. Certainly, a ceasefire now would give us a great negotiating position. However, total victory would allow us to dictate the terms, but pushing on may entail more international pressure and risk our forces to a Zionist counter-attack.
EGY_1973.3.a “Offer a ceasefire” 
EGY_1973.3.b “Let us complete our conquest!”

EGY_1973.4.t “Ultimatum from the United States”
EGY_1973.4.d “The Americans revealed themselves to be the Zionist stooges we always knew them to be. As our forces continue to pummel the Zionists and liberate more Palestinian land, we received a note from the United States. They have demanded we offer a ceasefire to the Zionists or they will intervene. Considering the Americans power and influence, such a threat cannot be taken lightly. We have already achieved so much and offering a ceasefire will be done from a position of strength. Perhaps now is the time to stop and celebrate our amazing achievements over the enemy. However, a number of senior officials point out this may all just be a bluff as the American government may not be able to rally its people to support a war which risks widening into a confrontation with the Soviet Union. Especially if it is over the fate of a foreign state.”
EGY_1973.4.a “Offer a ceasefire” 
EGY_1973.4.b “Ignore”

EGY_1973.5.t “The United States Intervenes”
EGY_1973.5.d “Cairo has been in a state of shock since news reached that the United States has joined the Zionists and will be deploying its military against our brave men. We had underestimated how deep the Zionists influence over the United States and thought they would not risk global peace for the sake of a foreign state. We plan on holding immediate talks with the Soviet ambassador to see if they can help. Despite this diplomatic setback, the success of our forces on the ground and the morale of our people will ensure we will be ready to face whatever challenges the Americans throw our way in their doomed effort to save the Zionists.
EGY_1973.5.a  “So they were not bluffing…”

EGY_1973.6.t “The Zionists Accept our Terms!”
EGY_1973.6.d “Operation Badr saw our brave forces breach the Zionist fortifications in Sinai, defenses they had proclaimed impenetrable. Once we broke through, our men were able to pressure the enemy and drive them out of the Sinai. Securing the Sinai has returned the sacred land back to the motherland. Our position of strength secured, we graciously offered the Zionists a ceasefire with the Sinai under our control. The cowardly enemy accepted our terms and now our troops are the masters of the Sinai. Thousands have taken to the street across Egypt to celebrate our stunning success over the Zionists. However, other Arab states have criticized us for halting, but that does not matter, we have restored Egyptian honor and delivered a crushing blow to the Zionists. 
EGY_1973.6.a “Victory!”

EGY_1973.7.t “The Zionists Accept our Terms!”
EGY_1973.7.d “The war began with Operation Badr in the Sinai. Its stunning success saw us drive off the Zionists from and liberate that sacred Egyptian land. Our forces then pushed on and in a series of victories have liberated a large portion of western and southern Palestine. With these lands secured, we offered the Zionists a ceasefire and the cowards accepted. Egypt now controls the Sinai and our brave armed forces will remain in Palestine to protect its people and oversee the removal of any Zionist presence within that land. Across the Arab world, hundreds of thousands have taken to the street to celebrate the victory of Arab arms and the liberation of Arab lands from years of occupation.”
EGY_1973.7.a “Victory!”

EGY_1973.8.t “The Zionists Refuse Ceasefire”
EGY_1973.8.d “Our forces have been routing the Zionists since the conflict began. They suffer defeat after defeat against our brave forces. We graciously offered them terms for a ceasefire and only ask that they accept our forces will remain in the land they have currently liberated. Yet despite our generosity, the Zionists instead rejected our terms. Their foolishness and delusions are their own fault and now our forces will have no choice but to keep on moving forward against the enemy.”
EGY_1973.8.a “So they choose death…”

EGY_1973.9.t The Zionists Offer Ceasefire”
EGY_1973.9.d “Our brave forces continue to battle the Zionist foe. Where we advance, they fall back and where they attack us, we bleed them down. The Zionists remain stunned at the tenacity, genius, and fighting prowess of our armed forces. As a result, they have offered us a ceasefire that would see both sides return to prewar borders. Of course, our men are doing exceptionally well in the field, but the commanders have noted the advance has been slow. We have proven ourselves as fighting men and perhaps a ceasefire will allow us to negotiate from a much stronger position now. However, although the advance has been slow, it may just be a matter of time before we breakthrough and turn the tide completely, why else would they offer a ceasefire? 
EGY_1973.9.a “Accept ceasefire”

EGY_1973.10.t “The Zionists Ceasefire Offer”
EGY_1973.10.d “The Zionists once again have offered a ceasefire to end the hostilities. Our brave men have stiffened their opposition and although we have lost key territories, the defense of Cairo remains strong. Among the senior officials, some argue accepting a ceasefire at this stage may reduce the harshness of the Zionist demands. However, another group argues negotiating or groveling to the enemy would be a disgrace to our great Arab nation. The choice is now to either accept the Zionist ceasefire or fight on to the last man, or, with the help of God, we may even change our fortunes.
EGY_1973.10.a “Accept ceasefire” 
EGY_1973.10.b “We will fight to the last!”

EGY_1973.11.t “The Soviet Union Intervenes”
EGY_1973.11.d “The Soviet Union has long been a friend to the people of Egypt and in our greatest struggle, they have come to our aid. The Soviet support will bolster our brave armed forces and raise the morale of our people. The Soviets had prepared a number of specialized troops for rapid deployment and we can expect them to start arriving soon. The Zionists and their gang of supporters will have to now deal with the Red Army and our forces. 
EGY_1973.11.a “We were not expecting special forces.”
