EGY_1973.1.t “Egypt Launches Operation Badr”
EGY_1973.1.d “After months of preparation, our armed forces are ready to launch Operation Badr. Operation Badr will allow our forces to breakthrough Zionist formations and penetrate the Sinai. The mistakes of previous conflicts will not be repeated. This time the war will be on our terms and we are prepared to drive through the enemy. The Zionists have grown complacent and many of their forces are on leave for Yom Kippur.  We are attacking in Ramadan, a most auspicious month which will only strengthen the belief of our soldiers on the front.”
EGY_1973.1.a “So it begins...”

EGY_1973.2.t “The Sinai is Ours!” 
EGY_1973.2.d “The Zionists have long proclaimed the Sinai as an unbreakable fortress but today our forces have not only breached their walls but now control the Sinai. Sinai is an arm of the Egyptian nation and its return to our just control inspires the nation. Millions across Egypt welcome the news and the morale of our forces on the front is overflowing. The decision facing our government and military is whether to offer a cease fire or press on. Since we have secured the Sinai, sovereign Egyptian land, we can fortify our positions and offer a ceasefire from a position of strength. However, doing so will risk alienating our Arab brothers who will want us to push on toward Jerusalem. Considering how well our forces are driving the enemy back, pressing on to end the Zionist threat once and for all is also an option. Achieving total victory would allow us to determine the future of the region but the resistance can be expected to intensify, and we risk wearing down our own forces. 
EGY_1973.2.a “Offer a ceasefire”
EGY_1973.2.b “Let us complete our conquest!”

EGY_1973.3.t “More Gains in Palestine!”
EGY_1973.3.d “From the Sinai, our troops have continued to press on into the Zionist territory, liberating swaths of Arab lands in Palestine. The Zionists continue to resist our forces, but our commanders have quietly expressed their own surprise at the success of our forces. However, as the military advances, it is moving further away from supply lines and there is a worry of over-extension from senior commanders. It must now be decided whether we declare a ceasefire and negotiate with the Sinai and key parts of Palestine under our control, or if we should continue to press for a final victory. Certainly, a ceasefire now would give us a great negotiating position. However, total victory would allow us to dictate the terms, but pushing on may entail more international pressure and risk our forces to a Zionist counter-attack.
EGY_1973.3.a “Offer a ceasefire” 
EGY_1973.3.b “Let us complete our conquest!”

EGY_1973.4.t “Ultimatum from the United States”
EGY_1973.4.d “The Americans revealed themselves to be the Zionist stooges we always knew them to be. As our forces continue to pummel the Zionists and liberate more Palestinian land, we received a note from the United States. They have demanded we offer a ceasefire to the Zionists or they will intervene. Considering the Americans power and influence, such a threat cannot be taken lightly. We have already achieved so much and offering a ceasefire will be done from a position of strength. Perhaps now is the time to stop and celebrate our amazing achievements over the enemy. However, a number of senior officials point out this may all just be a bluff as the American government may not be able to rally its people to support a war which risks widening into a confrontation with the Soviet Union. Especially if it is over the fate of a foreign state.”
EGY_1973.4.a “Offer a ceasefire” 
EGY_1973.4.b “Ignore”

EGY_1973.5.t “The United States Intervenes”
EGY_1973.5.d “Cairo has been in a state of shock since news reached that the United States has joined the Zionists and will be deploying its military against our brave men. We had underestimated how deep the Zionists influence over the United States and thought they would not risk global peace for the sake of a foreign state. We plan on holding immediate talks with the Soviet ambassador to see if they can help. Despite this diplomatic setback, the success of our forces on the ground and the morale of our people will ensure we will be ready to face whatever challenges the Americans throw our way in their doomed effort to save the Zionists.
EGY_1973.5.a  “So they were not bluffing…”

EGY_1973.6.t “The Zionists Accept our Terms!”
EGY_1973.6.d “Operation Badr saw our brave forces breach the Zionist fortifications in Sinai, defenses they had proclaimed impenetrable. Once we broke through, our men were able to pressure the enemy and drive them out of the Sinai. Securing the Sinai has returned the sacred land back to the motherland. Our position of strength secured, we graciously offered the Zionists a ceasefire with the Sinai under our control. The cowardly enemy accepted our terms and now our troops are the masters of the Sinai. Thousands have taken to the street across Egypt to celebrate our stunning success over the Zionists. However, other Arab states have criticized us for halting, but that does not matter, we have restored Egyptian honor and delivered a crushing blow to the Zionists. 
EGY_1973.6.a “Victory!”

EGY_1973.7.t “The Zionists Accept our Terms!”
EGY_1973.7.d “The war began with Operation Badr in the Sinai. Its stunning success saw us drive off the Zionists from and liberate that sacred Egyptian land. Our forces then pushed on and in a series of victories have liberated a large portion of western and southern Palestine. With these lands secured, we offered the Zionists a ceasefire and the cowards accepted. Egypt now controls the Sinai and our brave armed forces will remain in Palestine to protect its people and oversee the removal of any Zionist presence within that land. Across the Arab world, hundreds of thousands have taken to the street to celebrate the victory of Arab arms and the liberation of Arab lands from years of occupation.”
EGY_1973.7.a “Victory!”

EGY_1973.8.t “The Zionists Refuse Ceasefire”
EGY_1973.8.d “Our forces have been routing the Zionists since the conflict began. They suffer defeat after defeat against our brave forces. We graciously offered them terms for a ceasefire and only ask that they accept our forces will remain in the land they have currently liberated. Yet despite our generosity, the Zionists instead rejected our terms. Their foolishness and delusions are their own fault and now our forces will have no choice but to keep on moving forward against the enemy.”
EGY_1973.8.a “So they choose death…”

EGY_1973.9.t The Zionists Offer Ceasefire”
EGY_1973.9.d “Our brave forces continue to battle the Zionist foe. Where we advance, they fall back and where they attack us, we bleed them down. The Zionists remain stunned at the tenacity, genius, and fighting prowess of our armed forces. As a result, they have offered us a ceasefire that would see both sides return to prewar borders. Of course, our men are doing exceptionally well in the field, but the commanders have noted the advance has been slow. We have proven ourselves as fighting men and perhaps a ceasefire will allow us to negotiate from a much stronger position now. However, although the advance has been slow, it may just be a matter of time before we breakthrough and turn the tide completely, why else would they offer a ceasefire? 
EGY_1973.9.a “Accept ceasefire”

EGY_1973.10.t “The Zionists' Second Ceasefire Offer”
EGY_1973.10.d “The Zionists once again have offered a ceasefire to end the hostilities. Our brave men have stiffened their opposition and although we have lost key territories, the defense of Cairo remains strong. Among the senior officials, some argue accepting a ceasefire at this stage may reduce the harshness of the Zionist demands. However, another group argues negotiating or groveling to the enemy would be a disgrace to our great Arab nation. The choice is now to either accept the Zionist ceasefire or fight on to the last man, or, with the help of God, we may even change our fortunes.
EGY_1973.10.a “Accept ceasefire” 
EGY_1973.10.b “We will fight to the last!”

EGY_1973.11.t “The Soviet Union Intervenes”
EGY_1973.11.d “The Soviet Union has long been a friend to the people of Egypt and in our greatest struggle, they have come to our aid. The Soviet support will bolster our brave armed forces and raise the morale of our people. The Soviets had prepared a number of specialized troops for rapid deployment and we can expect them to start arriving soon. The Zionists and their gang of supporters will have to now deal with the Red Army and our forces. 
EGY_1973.11.a “We were not expecting special forces.”

ISR_1973.1.t “Reports of Egyptian Mobilization”
ISR_1973.1.d “From forward positions in the Sinai and other intelligence assets, we have received multiple reports that the Egyptians have begun mobilizing their forces. The massing of Arab troops and equipment to our border is of concern. Some in the cabinet feel the mobilization may just be posturing to placate the domestic population and warn an escalation by our forces could turn international opinion completely against us. Others however, advocate we cancel the Yom Kippur leave many of our personnel are enjoying and deploy them to the front immediately. They advocate we cannot give the initiative to the enemy.”
ISR_1973.1.a “Holiday is cancelled! To arms!”

ISR_1973.2.t “Reports of Syrian Mobilization”
ISR_1973.2.d “From forward positions in the Golan and other intelligence assets, we have received multiple reports that the Syrians have begun mobilizing their forces. The massing of Arab troops from one of our most dangerous neighbors is of concern. Some in the cabinet feel the mobilization may just be posturing to placate the domestic population and warn an escalation by our forces could turn international opinion completely against us. Others however, advocate we cancel the Yom Kippur leave many of our personnel are enjoying and deploy them to the front immediately. They advocate we cannot give the initiative to the enemy.”
ISR_1973.2.a “Holiday is cancelled! To arms!” 

ISR_1973.3.t “Egypt offers a Ceasefire”
ISR_1973.3.d “Our brave warriors in the IDF continue to resist the Arab aggression in the Sinai. Despite our best efforts however, the troops have been forced out of the Sinai and are now positioned to defend the homeland from aggression. The Egyptians, no doubt aware their treacherous attack no longer has the surprise it did have offered us a ceasefire that accepts their occupation of Sinai. If we accept the ceasefire now, we will still have our land intact and can focus on other threats and regrouping from the initial losses. However, some IDF leaders suggest the Egyptians have spent all their tricks and soon we will be able to strike back and drive them over the canal.”
ISR_1973.3.a “Accept ceasefire” 
ISR_1973.3.b “We will fight to the last!”

ISR_1973.4.t “Egypt Offers Ceasefire”
ISR_1973.4.d “No one can doubt the courage and tenacity of the IDF. Against overwhelming Arab aggression, the IDF continues to fight and bleed the enemy for every inch of our sacred soil they take. This is why the Egyptians have recently sent a ceasefire offer to us. Accepting it will mean allowing Arab armies to occupy Sinai, Gaza, and southern Israel. Although we would be losing our land, at the very least it will buy us time to regroup and ensure the survival of the rest of Israel. However, some senior officials suggest we fight on, trust in our faith and people. To be at the mercy of our enemy would be a worse fate than death.”
ISR_1973.4.a “Accept ceasefire” 
ISR_1973.4.b “We will fight to the last!”

ISR_1973.5.t “United States Decides to Intervene”
ISR_1973.5.d “In what many in Israel liken to a biblical miracle, the United States has agreed to intervene and save Israel from the Arab aggression threatening to destroy the nation. The United States announcement has come as our IDF continues to resist from its last bastions of defense. The arrival of American support will no doubt turn the tide and already specialist forces are said to be in route to the region. Our intelligence reports the mood in Cairo has changed from jubilation to abject horror.”
ISR_1973.5.a “We weren't expecting special forces.”

ISR_1973.6.t “Soviets Issue Ultimatum”
ISR_1973.6.d “The Soviet Union issued a note to our government demanding we offer an immediate ceasefire to the Egyptians or face a Soviet intervention. Although the Arabs cowardly attacked us without warning, the IDF has successfully beaten them back and our forces are deep in Egypt, ensuring they will never think to harm our people again. Many senior cabinet members suggest the message to Egypt has been sent at this point and to offer the ceasefire, however, there are also several cabinet and IDF officers who believe the Soviets are simply bluffing. They suggest the Soviets are only placating the Egyptians and would not seriously consider intervening directly.”
ISR_1973.6.a “Offer ceasefire to Egypt” 
ISR_1973.6.b “Ignore”

ISR_1973.7.t “Soviet Union Intervenes…”
ISR_1973.7.d “The Soviet Union announcement it would immediately intervene in the war has transformed the mood among our people to that of mourning. The satisfaction and pride we had felt earlier for our soldiers who have taken the war deep into an enemy which had so treacherously attacked us has now turned into a fear for them and our own survival.  The government had failed to read the Soviet intentions and now must suffer the consequences, however, despite this setback we will persevere.”
ISR_1973.7.a “So they weren't bluffing...”

ISR_1973.8.t “Soviets Issue Ultimatum”
ISR_1973.8.d “The Soviet Union issued a note to our government demanding we offer an immediate ceasefire to the Syrian government or face a Soviet intervention. Although the Arabs cowardly attacked us without warning, the IDF has successfully beaten them back and our forces are deep in Syria to ensure they do not think to harm our people again. Many senior cabinet members suggest this message to Syria has been sent at this point and to offer the ceasefire, however, there are also several cabinet and IDF officers who believe the Soviets are simply bluffing. They suggest the Soviets are only placating the Syrians and would not seriously consider intervening directly.”
ISR_1973.8.a “Offer ceasefire to Syria”
ISR_1973.8.b “Ignore”

ISR_1973.9.t “Sinai Holds Strong!”
ISR_1973.9.d “Despite extensive preparations and the massing of huge forces, the Arab attempt to breakthrough the Sinai has clearly failed. The Egyptians thought they could launch a cowardly attack without our knowledge and destroy our presence in the Sinai. However, the IDF proved to be the superior force and our stubborn resistance and counter-attacks have ensured our victory and dominance in the Sinai. Some suggest this is the time to offer a ceasefire and end hostilities as we remain in control and have defeated the attack. Others however, believe the Arabs must be taught a lesson and the IDF should press on. An overwhelming victory could provide us decades of security.”
ISR_1973.9.a “Offer cease-fire to Egypt”
ISR_1973.9.b “We will finish them!”

ISR_1973.10.t “Israel Crosses the Suez”
ISR_1973.10.d “The IDF crossed the Suez and have pushed the battered Egyptians to the outskirts of Cairo. The Arab losses continue to mount and their morale no doubt has collapsed. International mediators suggest the Egyptians have had enough and are likely to accept a ceasefire. With victory assured, it makes sense to offer a ceasefire at this stage and end the fighting. This will allow us to regroup, negotiate from a position of strength, and improve our standing internationally. However, there are some senior officials and IDF officers who are suggesting we push forward and march on till the Arabs have nowhere else to retreat.”
ISR_1973.10.a “Offer cease-fire to Egypt” 
ISR_1973.10.b “We will finish them!”

ISR_1973.11.t “Egypt Agrees to Ceasefire!”
ISR_1973.11.d “The Egyptians had thought they could break through our lines and take the Sinai from us. However, the IDF proved once again to be far too superior to the enemy. The treacherous Egyptian attempt has been thwarted and they have accepted our generous offer of a ceasefire. The IDF fought tenaciously and with steely determination to keep the Sinai under our control. The Sinai remains a bastion of Israeli defense and with this success we hope the Egyptians will now see they have no chance to change the status quo through the force of arms. This is a great victory for Israel and the IDF.”
ISR_1973.11.a “Victory!”

ISR_1973.12.t “Egypt Accepts Ceasefire!”
ISR_1973.12.d “The Egyptians accepted our ceasefire offer, confirming the devastating defeat they have suffered. Their treacherous attempt to seize the Sinai through military force was not just thwarted by the IDF but we turned it into an advance into Egypt. We not only stopped them from taking the Sinai, but our brave forces took the fight into Egypt and captured the vital Suez from the enemy. From here on Egypt will think twice about threatening our existence.”
ISR_1973.12.a “Victory!”

ISR_1973.13.t “Egypt Rejects Peace Offer”
ISR_1973.13.d “The Egyptians said no to our recent offer of a ceasefire. They are clearly too embarrassed by their failures against our forces to accept the ground reality. Following the rejection, a meeting was held with senior officials and IDF officers. The IDF stated they will continue to punish the Egyptians and make them regret their refusal to negotiate. If they are hoping for a letdown or better terms, they will not receive them from our forces who will continue operations with the same vigor as before.”
ISR_1973.13.a “So they chose death...”

ISR_1973.14.t “Golan remains firm!”
ISR_1973.14.d “Despite extensive preparations and the massing of huge forces, the Arab attempt to breakthrough the Golan has clearly failed. The Syrians thought they could launch a cowardly attack without our knowledge and destroy our presence in the highlands. However, the IDF proved to be the superior force and our stubborn resistance and counter-attacks have ensured our victory and dominance in the Golan Heights. Some suggest this is the time to offer a ceasefire and end hostilities as we remain in control and have defeated the attack. Others however, believe the Arabs must be taught a lesson and the IDF should press on. An overwhelming victory could provide us decades of security.”
ISR_1973.14.a “Offer cease-fire to Syria”
ISR_1973.14.b “We will finish them!”

ISR_1973.15.t “Israel Crosses the Golan”
ISR_1973.15.d “The IDF crossed the Golan and have pushed the battered Syrians to the outskirts of Damascus. The Arab losses continue to mount and their morale no doubt has collapsed. International mediators suggest the Syrians have had enough and are likely to accept a ceasefire. With victory assured, it makes sense to offer a ceasefire at this stage and end the fighting. This will allow us to regroup, negotiate from a position of strength, and improve our standing internationally. However, there are some senior officials and IDF officers who are suggesting we push forward and march on till the Arabs have nowhere else to retreat.”

The Golan remains a bastion of Israeli defense and with this success we hope the Syrians will now recognize they have no chance to change the status quo through the force of arms. This is a great victory for Israel and the IDF.”
ISR_1973.16.a “Victory!”

ISR_1973.17.t "Syria Accepts Ceasefire!"
ISR_1973.17.d “The Syrians accepted our ceasefire offer, confirming the devastating defeat they have suffered. Their treacherous attempt to seize the Golan through military force was not just thwarted by the IDF but we turned it into an advance into Syria. The brave men and women of the IDF took the fight into Syria and were poised to advance on Damascus itself. From here on Syria will think twice about threatening our existence.”
ISR_1973.17.a “Victory!”

ISR_1973.18.t “Syria Rejects Ceasefire”
