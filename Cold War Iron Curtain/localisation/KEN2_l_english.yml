 kenya.1.d:0 "  Oh sweet Chief, how we loved you so! Last night, the commonwealth lost one of its most loyal and charasmatic figures in East Africa. Just outside of Nairobi the beloved chief was being chauffered when three gunmen shot through the car, killing Waruhiu instantly. Waruhiu was a true advocate for British colonial rule, an outspoken critic of independence groups and various indeginous people vying for unnecessary autonomy. These murderers are being referred to as Mau Mau, our secretaries are linking this assassination with multiple other murders and acts of violence towards white settlers in the colony and protectorate of Kenya."

 kenya.4.d:0 "Kenya like many Swahili nations is filled with many ethnic organizations and movements inscrutable to outside British observers. Traveling mystics, cult leaders, and tribal populists, and such wonder throughout the country but recently there have been reports of large movements of Kikuyu tribesmen; traveling as organized armies. This, culminating with recent hostilities of indeginous peoples and white settlers in the highlands, is leading some to wonder if something more sinister is afoot."
