 air_doctrine_integral:0 "Tactical Integrity Doctrine"
 air_doctrine_integral_desc:0 "While strategic initiatives and operations can provide key benefits, an army is only as strong as its weakest link. By ensuring that we are powerful and indomitable on an operational and tactical level, we can utterly crush the enemy with sheer direct force."
 
 #VERSATILE#
 
 air_doctrine_versatile_1a:0 "Night Ops"
 air_doctrine_versatile_1a_desc:0 "Training our pilots to operate and identify friend-or-foe in low light conditions will enable them to have greater success during nighttime operations, giving greater flexibility on when operations can be conducted. Additionally, this training can also aid during bad weather scenarios where visibility is low."
 air_doctrine_versatile_1b:0 "Meteorological Networks"
 air_doctrine_versatile_1b_desc:0 "Optimally, we would not begin operations in unfavorable weather. However, warfare is unpredictable and we must sometimes deal with operating in unsavory conditions. To better cope with this, a meteorological network dedicated to predicting the weather and providing key information to our best bet to cope with it."
 air_doctrine_versatile_2:0 "Radio Navigation Control"
 air_doctrine_versatile_2_desc:0 "We can heavily invest in aeronautic navigation methods to improve the mission efficiency of our air force and expand the capability of our navigational teams at mission control."
 air_doctrine_versatile_3a:0 "Expanded Training Squadrons"
 air_doctrine_versatile_3a_desc:0 "Training squadrons are units that specialize in airforce training and teach new pilots how to perform their operations properly. By expanding the capacity of the squadrons and creating a more robust regimen, we can allow our air wings to be more prepared for combat and speed up exercises."
 air_doctrine_versatile_3b:0 "Emergency Training"
 air_doctrine_versatile_3b_desc:0 "Our training regimen lacks proper emergency situation training. Our pilots need to learn how to deal with engine failures or weather damage with brutal efficiency."
 air_doctrine_versatile_4:0 "Adaptive Formations"

Teaching pilots how to exploit these opportunities allows us to get the most out of our multiroles."
 air_doctrine_versatile_8:0 "Predictive Lock-on Algorithm"
 air_doctrine_versatile_8_desc:0 "Using predictive algorithms, our missiles can attempt to rengage and home in on targets they have lost until they can be reacquired. This way, the enemy is in even greater danger in the clouds because we can still seek them even if they cannot see us."

As such, it is important to develop a national standardized catalog of military provisions to make it easier for supply officers to manage."
 tech_logistics_company4:0 "Logistics IV; Light/Compact Containers"
 tech_logistics_company4_desc:0 "Weight is a serious concern in logistics. Vehicles can only transport so much weight and even still have restrictions to the volume of contents they can transport. By creating lightweight, strong, compact containers, more supply can be shipped faster and more fuel efficiently."
 tech_logistics_company5:0 "Logistics V; All-Terrain Supply Corps"
 tech_logistics_company5_desc:0 "You cannot always rely on using your enemy’s infrastructure and roads. They may be destroyed in an action of scorched earth or may not exist in the first place. On that note, you can’t always rely on your own infrastructure not being destroyed or even existing. It is important that supply vehicles and logistics officers be able to travel off-road and find new paths in order to improve movement."
 tech_logistics_company6:0 "Logistics VI; Efficient Air Missions"
 tech_logistics_company6_desc:0 "Air missions and paradropped supplies can be lost, destroyed, captured by the enemy or partisans, or even take up large quantities of fuel to deliver. By revising paradropping plans and the chutes themselves, air missions can deliver needed supply in faster amounts of time. "
 tech_logistics_company7:0 "Logistics VII; High-Capacity Vehicles"
 tech_logistics_company7_desc:0 "When all management methods and protocols have been fully optimized, the only thing left to do is just make vehicles stronger, more efficient, and hold more. That’s all there is to it."
 
 ##MP
 
 tech_military_police:0 "Military Police I; MP Corps"
 tech_military_police_desc:0 "Military Police are dedicated officer corps that maintain order within’ a division as well as provide security in a combat zone. War is, by its very nature, destructive. Government officials, police, and security operatives are natural targets and belligerents in a conflict so military police must retain order and suppress insurgency. Basic military police are no more advanced or different from normal police forces with the exception of more combat training and the ability to establish beats within’ an unfamiliar zone."
 tech_military_police2:0 "Military Police II; Counter-Insurgent Operations"
 tech_military_police2_desc:0 "Insurgents and partisans can be extremely dangerous to a war operation and provide problems on a strategic level. From sabotose to ambushes to providing the enemy with intel, anyone can become an insurgent. Being able to hunt insurgents and partisans and suppress rebellion in a warzone is a critical operation. Firearms and weapons must be confiscated, militia cells must be found and destroyed, and the operatives themselves must be terminated. Therefore special equipment and militarized variants of police equipment must be made and protocols for suppression must be planned."
 tech_military_police3:0 "Military Police III; Riot Control"
 tech_military_police3_desc:0 "Aside from militia cells, disorganized riots can also arise from rebelling populations who do not have an understanding of guerilla warfare or resistance theory. Although not as dangerous as a fully organized militia cell, riots can cause serious disorder, prevent access to resources and industry, and rally support for partisans. It is therefore necessary to control and put down riots. However, using shear lethal force, although easy and effective, only radicalizes local populations and fulfills the riot’s initial purpose. Thus, developing military grade riot control techniques in order to maintain order and suppress demonstration is of vital importance."
 tech_military_police4:0 "Military Police IV; War Relief Corps"
 tech_military_police4_desc:0 "It is not enough to merely suppress resistance and pacify populations. Peaceful resistance is always possible and can be problematic. Additionally, the shear devastation caused by war can lead partisans to form cells. Providing war relief is prudent for numerous reasons. War relief helps a region recover faster during and after a war. War relief helps maintain wealth and development that would otherwise be lost. War relief speeds up recovery. Finally, providing war relief can win the most important war of all. The war of hearts and minds. "
 tech_military_police5:0 "Military Police V; Peacekeeping"
 tech_military_police5_desc:0 "Peacekeeping is a proactive measure to preventing uprisings and reducing devastation. Peacekeeping operations typically involve training new, local security forces to enforce the law and restore normalcy. Order and stability are the greatest methods of pacification. Peacekeeping requires military police to be trained to establish local security and vet for individuals who will not wind up becoming problems to become those security operatives. Additionally, it requires logistical lines for security provisions to be established so security beats can be established."
 tech_military_police6:0 "Military Police VI; Memetic Suppression"
 tech_military_police6_desc:0 "Winning hearts and minds with war relief and peacekeeping are good ways to prevent insurgency. However, not everyone is convinced, especially patriots and demagogues. It is therefore necessary to use fear as a tool to suppress other individuals. However, this fear cannot be delivered in such a way that it interferes with war relief or peacekeeping. Military reporters, propaganda, memetic warfare and ideological debating, and other such methods are ways to sow doubt within’ an occupied population. "
 tech_military_police7:0 "Military Police VII; Modern Non-Lethal Weapons and Tactics"
 tech_military_police7_desc:0 "Non-lethal tactics and weapons have been used since the dawn of human civilization and are naturally a part of occupation. However, dealing with domestic crime is a different game than dealing with insurgents. To better control the population and not inspire resistance and provide psychological suppression, new methods for incapacitation must be created. Investing large amounts into developing non-lethal weapons, chemicals, training, and equipment will pay off by enabling smaller amounts of troops to have a greater suppressive impact."
 
 ##SIGNAL
 
 tech_signal_company:0 "Signal I; Command and Control"
 tech_signal_company_desc:0 "Signal Companies maintain organization and communication within’ a division and outside of it. Using communications equipment, signal companies can aid in the command and control of a division and enable it to react to situations better than before. Command and Control requires signal specialists and communications equipment."
 tech_signal_company2:0 "Signal II; C3"
 tech_signal_company2_desc:0 "C3 stands for Communications, Command, and Control. With the implementation of C3, units can now communicate between one another and react dynamically to enemy movements and breakthroughs and respond accordingly. C3 requires signal specialists to be integrated throughout a division in many different areas to relay information and provide greater awareness."
 tech_signal_company3:0 "Signal III; Interoperability"
 tech_signal_company3_desc:0 "Interoperability is the advancement of C3. Interoperability is the advancement of doctrines in communication and direct efforts between combat elements. This way, combat elements are able to communicate with each-other without the need of a signal liaison and can aid each-other through their own initiative. "
 tech_signal_company4:0 "Signal IV; ISTAR"
 tech_signal_company4_desc:0 "ISTAR stands for Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition, and Reconnaissance. It is the active communication between recon elements and everyone on the communications network. ISTAR enables recon elements to communicate information to the rest of a division with high efficiency. It also enables undedicated recon elements to aid in providing information to combat elements that need them."
 tech_signal_company5:0 "Signal V; MISI"
 tech_signal_company5_desc:0 "Modern Informations System Integration [MISI] is the integration of modern systems information such as portable computers to aid in tactical control. With MISI, unparalleled levels of direct tactical control can be established between command staff and the operating combat elements. MISI enables consultation between experienced senior staff and low-ranking officers to provide greater combat and tactical capability."
 tech_signal_company6:0 "Signal VI; Personal Comms"
 tech_signal_company6_desc:0 "Personal Comms are pieces of communications equipment granted to almost all individuals within’ a division. This can further allow communications to be maintained as the incapacitation of a signals specialist does not necessarily mean the end of communications. Developing personal comms requires miniaturization of communications equipment and protocols for cutting off the operability of compromised equipment."
 tech_signal_company7:0 "Signal VII; OVERLORD"
 tech_signal_company7_desc:0 "OVERLORD is a theoretical battle interface that has not yet been fully implemented by any country due to the sheer expense of developing the software needed and maintaining and updating it. OVERLORD creates an interface created and updated by command staff based off of continuous recon reports and information coming in. This allows for a level of interoperability, communication, and command never before seen that can enable virtually all troops to receive information on nearby troops and avoid conflicts they cannot deal with while precisely engaging hostiles they are able to. As long as someone is aware of an enemy presence, and communications are still online, everyone can be aware of it. "
 
 ##MAINTENANCE 
 
 tech_maintenance_company:0 "Maintenance I; Army Mechanics"
 tech_maintenance_company_desc:0 "Maintenance companies are dedicated non-combat units that specialize in the maintenance and repair of military weapons and equipment. While most routine cleaning and maintenance can be performed by the soldiers that operate the weapons and equipment, dedicated mechanics can do the job more efficiently and relieve a lot of the effort on part from the soldiers themselves so they can focus on other things. Mechanics are the most basic but amongst the most important elements of a maintenance company."
 tech_maintenance_company2:0 "Maintenance II; Management"
 tech_maintenance_company2_desc:0 "Maintenance management and military foremen are crucial to the efficiency of maintenance companies.

 tech_maintenance_company4_desc:0 "Further optimizing tools to make them more reliable and easy-to-handle aids field repairs and regular maintenance even more."
 tech_maintenance_company5:0 "Maintenance V; Versitile Parts"
 tech_maintenance_company5_desc:0 "In warfare it isn’t uncommon to find maintenance companies running out of components or spare parts. The parts that are damaged or destroyed are highly inconsistent and unpredictable due to the nature of combat. It is for this reason that having stores of extra versatile parts and patching kits that are intended to only be applied temporarily is desirable. Through intense development efforts and investment, these kits and parts can be created for field repairs in order to keep vehicles and weapons in the fight long enough that they can receive permanent repairs."
 tech_maintenance_company6:0 "Maintenance VI; Combat Mechanics"
 tech_maintenance_company6_desc:0 "The most dire repair situations can occur in the heat of a firefight. Tanks can become detracked, vehicles can be shot, and various other forms of damage can occur. Field repairs have always been a difficult task and have always been pressing. By training mechanics to work faster and under intense pressure, they can conduct these repairs more efficiently and get their vehicles back in the fight."
 tech_maintenance_company7:0 "Maintenance VII; Digital Manuals"
 tech_maintenance_company7_desc:0 "By providing our combat mechanics with portable devices containing information on whatever they are working on they can achieve greater levels of efficiency never seen before."

The NSVT featured improvements such as lighter weight from simplified parts and more modernized materials to allow the weapon to sustain fire for longer. It was also around this time that various attachments were developed for the HMG. The NSVT is well known for being mounted on Soviet MBTs such as the 64, the 72, and the 80.\nThe 2B14 is a modern light indirect fire mortar designed in 1983 by the Nizni Novgorod Engineering Plant for use in airborne and light infantry forces.

The M1 Bazooka is one of the first rocket propelled anti tank weapons. It could be used against bunkers, armored vehicles, machine gun nests, or tanks. Some copies of the M1 were captured by German forces quickly after being rolled out and they were reverse engineered to create the Panzerschreck. The M1 costs very little and overwhelming amounts of surplus ammunition were created so it was used in future wars and is still used by low-budget armies today. At its current rate of usage, the weapon will likely continue see combat by low-budget armies.

However, the Soviet Union did not develop their own anti tank infantry weapons and relied heavily on lend leases. The Dyakanov was developed by Dyakanov MG in 1917 and can launch specially built muzzle-loaded explosives such as anti-tank or anti-personnel grenades. The weapon itself saw heavily usage in WWII but was quickly dropped after the end of the war in favor of the Soviet Union developing better infantry grenade launchers and proper MANPATS."
 SOV_manpats_2: "RPG-7"
 SOV_manpats_2_short: "RPG-7"
 SOV_manpats_2_desc: "The RPG-7 is a rocket propelled anti-tank grenade developed in 1958 by Bazalt weapons manufacturing company. The RPG-7 is well known for its simplicity, low cost, high effectiveness, and incredible longevity and reliability. It is capable of firing standard, HEAT rounds, fragmentation, and thermobaric rounds. It is comprised of a very simple system lending to its low cost and ease of maintenance. It is based around a steel tube and the middle is cased with wood to protect from heat. The end is flared to aid in blast shielding the user and providing recoil reduction. When fired, it simply strikes the firing pin like a regular firearm to ignite the grenade. It has been ubiquitously since its inception and has been seen in virtually all combat in every place on Earth."
 SOV_manpats_3: "RPG-18"
 SOV_manpats_3_short: "RPG-18"
 SOV_manpats_3_desc: "The RPG-19 was developed by Bazalt weapons manufacturing in the early 1970s. The RPG-18 fires a 64 mm HEAT warhead and has an effective range of 200 meters. The warhead always self-destructs after 6 seconds which places a definite limit. The RPG-18 was not used as much as the RPG-7 nor has it made its way around the world as much due to the fact that it cannot be reloaded. It is, however, very cheap despite being more logistically cumbersome as each tube only fires once. It was used extensively in various wars by China as well as the Soviet-Afghan war."
 SOV_manpats_4: "RPG-29"
 SOV_manpats_4_short: "RPG-29"
 SOV_manpats_4_desc: "The RPG-29 is a reloadable anti-tank RPG developed by Bazalt in the late 1980s. It was developed to provide a modern, improved variant of the RPG-7 and is reloadable unlike the RPG-18. It fires rockets at an effective range of approximately 600 meters and is not limited by a timed warhead. It is far more capable of penetrating armor than the RPG-7 although it did not entirely faze out the RPG-7 or the RPG-18 due to its higher cost. The RPG-29 also does not have an initial propellant charge to protect the operators as the rocket ignites in order to reduce weight and give more valuable weight value that can be used for more rocket fuel. This means it is not as easy to use and requires a level of protection for its user but makes it more effective. The RPG-29 has been used in the Iraq war, the Syrian civil war, and the 2006 lebanon war."
 SOV_manpats_5: "RPG-32"
 SOV_manpats_5_short: "RPG-32"
 SOV_manpats_5_desc: "The RPG-32 is a modern Russian anti-tank infantry weapon developed by Bazalt in 2005. The weapon has an effective range of approximately 350m with a maximum range of 700m. The launcher comes with 2 different 72 or 105mm warheads that are thermobaric or HEAT. It has a far greater armor piercing capability than any of its predecessors. It has not yet been rolled out or accepted by the Russian army due to its high cost although several middle eastern countries do import it from Russia mostly for usage in their army’s higher-end battalions. It is currently in use in the Iraqi civil war and the Yemeni civil war."

 SOV_hmg_1_short: "DShK"
 SOV_hmg_1_desc: "The DShK heavy machine gun is a gas-operated flapper-locked HMG developed in 1938 by Vasily Degtyaryov. The weapon itself was used as both an HMG and sometimes as a small anti-air weapon by infantry in WWII. More than 1 million have been manufactured today and due to its low cost and ease-of-manufacture continues to be made by many underdeveloped nations around the world with notable success."
 SOV_manpads_1: "Strela-2"
 SOV_manpads_1_short: "Strela-2"
 SOV_manpads_1_desc: "The Strela-2 is a MANPAD infantry portable anti-air missile launcher was a backbone weapon of the Soviet-sphere. Designed by KBM in 1964, the weapon featured a non-delay impact detonation fuze, an HE explosive warhead, and a proportional navigation logic missile guidance system. It proved to be relatively inexpensive to mass manufacture. However, it was noted quickly by Soviet high command that the Strela-2 performed poorly and far below what they expected the weapon to perform at. It has seen conflict in the Soviet-Afghan war, many different communist revolutions, as well as extensive use in middle eastern conflicts. "
 SOV_manpads_2: "Strela-3"
 SOV_manpads_2_short: "Strela-3"
 SOV_manpads_2_desc: "The Soviet Union quickly began developing the Strela-3 after it was noted that the Strela-2 had performed ineffectively in combat. KBM finished development of the Strela-3 in 1974 and it proved to be far more capable. Instead of proportional navigation logic, the Strela-3 used infrared homing to hit targets far beyond the effective range of the Strela-2. Additionally, it came with a detector element cooler in the missile itself, allowing it to be less easily fooled by flares and more accurately seek out true targets. Despite this, the additions made the missile heavier and require a more expensive propulsion fuel, making each round more expensive. The Strela-3 was used in many different middle eastern conflicts such as the Iraq-Iran war, but didn’t see much combat within’ the Soviet sphere itself."
 SOV_manpads_3: "Igla"
 SOV_manpads_3_short: "Igla"
 SOV_manpads_3_desc: "The Igla is an improved MANPAD system developed by KBM in 1981. The Igla uses a dual-waveband infrared guidance system and has a delayed impact magnetic fuze detonation system. The missile also came with a aerospike to reduce drag and improve performance. The weapon has seen many general conflicts in the middle east but also the Yugoslavian wars."
 SOV_manpads_4: "Verba"
 SOV_manpads_4_short: "Verba"
 SOV_manpads_4_desc: "The Verba is a modern Russian MANPAD system created in 2011. It uses a 3 channel optical guidance system with an exceptional 5km flight ceiling and very long range. The weapon also comes with a modern, stronger warhead. The weapon itself is very difficult to fool with countermeasure systems due to the 3 channels it possesses in each missiles requiring high grade countermeasures to be used. The Verba is used by the Armenians, the Russians, and the Syrians but has only seen combat in Syria to date."

 SOV_protection_equip_1_short: "Steel Bib"
 SOV_protection_equip_1_desc: "The steel bib is an extremely early model of infantry protection equipment based from the steel cuirass and was made during WWI. The breastplates themselves were implemented around 1942 and results of usage during combat were mixed. The breastplates themselves worked in infantry heavy urban environments, but were burdensome in the field."
 SOV_protection_equip_2: "SN+SSh40"
 SOV_protection_equip_2_short: "SN+SSh40"
 SOV_protection_equip_2_desc: "The SN body armor and SSh40 helmets were developed close to the end of the second world war. The helmets themselves were sturdier than their previous versions."
 SOV_protection_equip_3: "6B5-15+STSh-81"
 SOV_protection_equip_3_short: "6B5-15+STSh-81"
 SOV_protection_equip_3_desc: "The 6B5-15 vest was developed by the Stali Soviet research institute and produced from 1986-1998. The vest itself used kevlar materials to protect the user and came with a series of multicam camouflages. The STSh-81 helmets are titanium and steel helmets also produced by Stali for the Soviet Union. The STSh-81 helmets demonstrated considerable strength in combat."
 SOV_protection_equip_4: "6B7"
 SOV_protection_equip_4_short: "6B7"
 SOV_protection_equip_4_desc: "Over time, the 6B5-15 ballistic armor would need to have more and improved harnesses and accessory components. Stali set out to create a full set of modern gear setups for most environments around the world that could be manufactured at will by the Soviet Union. The 6B7 helmets were an improved version of the STSh-81 helmets and acted as successors to their former design. Stali made them with more modern materials such as an improved internal steel structure that could more effectively deflect the force coming from bullets."
 SOV_protection_equip_5: "6B45+6B47"
 SOV_protection_equip_5_short: "6B45+6B47"
 SOV_protection_equip_5_desc: "Techinkom developed the 6B5 vests and infantry equipment in the early 2000s to meet the needs of modern combat. They were more maneuverable, durable, and effective than before. They featured modern shock-absorbing plating, came with weather and moisture resistant lining, and could easily give any soldier a massive edge in infantry combat. The 6B47 helmet and its equipment attachments provide greater protection for its wearers than before offering greater protection."

 hardware_I_desc:0 "Magnetic writing is a core component to magnetic core memory. Magnetic writing uses a switched magnet to switch the magnetized elements in a magnetized medium in order to create non-volatile memory. Early magnetic memories were not deemed commercially feasible due to their very small capability and the rate by which the magnetic pole needs to move around the disk. "
 hardware_II_desc:0 "Magnetic core memory is amongst the earliest forms of RAM. The core uses tiny magnetic rings with massive numbers of wires threaded to read and write information. Each core could hold one bit of information and would be magnetized in one direction or the other to store a 1 or zero. This allowed the temporary storage of data for extremely rapid access and modification, the same that RAM is used for today. It cannot be used as general data storage because it is extremely bulky compared to storage devices and also far more expensive to the bit, just like RAM today."
 hardware_III_desc:0 "First invented by IBM in 1956, the HDD was quickly adopted as the primary digital data storage device. The Hard Disk Drive [HDD] is a form of data storage that uses magnetic storage to read and right digital data. The disk uses a rapidly rotating disk coated with magnetic material. Magnetic heads can alter and read data on the disk while it is rotating. HDDs can store overwhelmingly more data that prior forms of digital storage."
 hardware_IV_desc:0 "Computer auxiliaries are items such as the keyboard, mouse, screen, etc. Computer auxiliaries exist in the primitive form before researching this. As computers get smaller and smaller, eventually they reach a point where basic auxiliaries become more important. These computers come with support for dynamic screens, improved and standardized keyboards, and better sound equipment for modifying and reading sound data. These auxiliaries pave the way for more applications of computing."
 hardware_V_desc:0 "While creating new forms of hardware increases the versatility of a computer, it is also necessary to optimize existing systems. Streamlining designs and drivers for systems such as the motherboard or the soundcard improves the capability of all the other systems around it and allows them to develop to further heights. "
 hardware_VI_desc:0 "Random Access Memory (RAM) is a form of data storage that has massive read-write speeds and is used for running programs. Without RAM, programs would run vastly slower and might not allow data to be read or written in the same amount of time relative to the physical location of the data. RAM contains multiplexing and demultiplexing circuitry (circuitry combining multiple digital signals into one shared signal)  to connect data lines to the addressed storage and allow for programs to easily access and modify data."

Allowing better sound quality and easy and accessible usage, these auxiliaries improve productivity and make them more accessible to the general public. Additionally, improving auxiliaries paves the way for compact removable storage disks."
 hardware_VIII_desc:0 "Digital Optical Data Storage is a form of data storage that uses lasers to store and retrieve data from optical mediums. These lasers are low-power beams to read and write data on an optical medium and allow for things such as CDs which can store vastly more data than the floppy disk and allow for a greater level of data transferrability."

Early computing theories led to the development of early electronic computers that more or less served the same role with similar capacity to mechanical computers but in a way that allowed them to take on vastly larger tasks and bring about the first major computers."
 software_II_desc:0 "The preset programming of early computers left a lot to be desired and only allowed computers to take on highly specific tasks with arduously assembled programs. Binary programming languages allowed computers to take on a vastly larger diversity of tasks and would also allow a greater level of accessibility in computing."
 software_III_desc:0 "A high-level programming language is a programming language that abstracts from the binary details of the computer’s processing itself. They read natural language [IE add_research_slot = 50] and turn that into a processable element. This allows them to be programmed on a macro level without the need to individually assign unabstracted elements to process data. "

It is used to sort data in a computer and outdid prior sorting algorithms like merge sort and heapsort. Sorting is an extremely common process conducted in computer software and as such, needs to be highly efficient and a poorly created sorting algorithm can lead to unnecessarily large processing loads. Quicksort is still used today because it’s just that good."
 software_V_desc:0 "Packet switching is a method of grouping digital sata and transmitting it over a digital network. They are led by a header and the data itself is in the payload which trails the header. The header navigates a network according to the data placed in it. This allows data to navigate highly complex networks where there are multiple hosts to reach and different data nodes to travel between. However, there are a few issues such as packet loss which affect packet switching networks. Wireless transmission [not available at the time of researching this] and network congestion can cause packets to fail to reach their destination and be lost. The Transmission Control Protocol is an internet protocol that ensures accurate data transfer and detects when packets are lost so it can try again or correct the errors."

As a result of design improvements and better administrative domains and internal protocols, massively-parallel supercomputers could become vast in size. These supercomputers can be used to store or back up more data than before, and process more than early models.

 software_X_desc:0 "64-bit computing is the use of 64-bit architecture in computers. Every 1 or 0 in a binary language takes up 1 bit. In 64-bit architecture, 64-bits are arranged into a single memory address, which is a reference to a specific memory location used at software and hardware levels. What makes 64-bits special is because 64-bit computers have an integer limit of 9,223,372,036,854,775,807, whereas 32-bit systems are capped at about 2.147 billion. This allows far more unique variables to be stored and processed by a system than ever before. There are simpler programs today that still use 32-bit, but many softwares need to use 64-bit architecture because of their sheer complexity."
 software_XI_desc:0 "Multi-threading is the ability of a CPU to provide multiple threads of execution concurrently. Multithreading increased the utilization of a single core by using thread-level parallelism and instruction-level parallelism. This enables a greater level of flexibility when multitasking whether a single core or multiple cores were being used.\nWhile simultaneous multi-threading has been around since 1968 and deployed within’ a few years of that, this technology represents the optimization of multi-threading protocols and the introduction of protocols to protect against multiple threads sharing hardware resources like caches and a high level of efficiency."

 radar_0_desc:0 "Throughout WWII, many advancements in radar were made. Early on, radar simply used radio detection which was very crude and inefficient. This was eventually sharpened to create decimetric radar, which could detect incoming planes from further away and do so more precisely. Eventually, decimetric radar was lengthened to centimetric to enable long range radar detection. In order to lengthen the radar waves, significant improvements to the strength of the cavity magnetron are made. The cavity magnetron is a high powered vacuum tube used to generate microwaves and turn them into radio waves. It was made stronger than ever and could create very powerful centimetric beams."
 radar_I_desc:0 "Doppler Beam Sharpening is a method of processing radar signals into a radar-image. Using a synthetic aperture, the motion of the radar antenna provides finer spatial resolution than conventional beam-scanning radars. SAR defines a 3D array of scene elements using returns from the beam. With this array, SAR runs algorithms and calculations to determine a precise image of whatever it is scanning."
 radar_II_desc:0 "Monopulse radar is a radar system that encodes its radio signal on different levels so when the beam bounces back, it provides highly accurate data based on how the different pulses come back. Because the radio signal uses additional encoding it is able to emit only 1 pulse for accurate data hence the name ‘monopulse’."
 radar_III_desc:0 "Over-the-Horizon Radar aka Skywave Radar is a radar that transmits a powerful shortwave signal that reaches beyond the horizon by reflecting off of the ionosphere in the sky to hit the ground over the horizon and then back to the sky and to the radar antennas again. This allows OtH to detect targets behind obstacles and over extremely long distances."

The digital encryption system enabled it to create messages more encrypted than ever before."

More combinations need to be added to prevent the likelihood of the machine using the same card multiple times. More measures need to be taken to prevent access to the machine. Also more layers must be added to the encrypted messages."
 enc_III_desc:0 "DES is the first public encryption standard created. The DES was created in 1975 by IBM. DES is a systemic-key algorithm meaning it used the same key for both encryption and decryption. As long as the key is kept secret between the 2 parties, the encryption is highly secure. If the key is guessed through a long and time-consuming brute force attack, or if the key is stolen quickly via malware, then the messages can be decrypted. DES is highly secure against differential cryptanalysis because the encryption keys are kept secret and unique, but is vulnerable against bruteforce cracking."
 enc_IV_desc:0 "The Firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules. Firewalls can effectively prevent malware that has infected a system from submitting information out of the system or prevent unauthorized access into a system. "
 enc_V_desc:0 "With the advent of malicious software comes the need for a dynamic approach to protecting against general vulnerability. While vulnerabilities can be patched, the never ending cold war of vulnerabilities vs exploits places the encrypter at a serious disadvantage. Dynamic antiviruses designed to directly block known malicious software signatures or heuristically block suspicious software activity. This enables defenses to stay ahead of threats by creating more advanced anti-viruses and anti-malwares."
 enc_VI_desc:0 "Simply reactively combatting viruses and known malicious signatures is not enough. As software becomes more ubiquitous and the world becomes more networked, the dangers continue to increase.

Bit-flipping is another attack that relies on already knowing part of a message. If the encrypted messages follow a certain format, then it is easy to use the known information as a base. "
 decryption_II_desc:0 "Differential cryptanalysis is a method of attack in which pairs of plaintext and ciphertext are abused in a cryptological system in order to discover a key. This requires access to the plaintext and ciphertext inputs and outputs. By inputting a variety of messages and comparing them to the encrypted text, the encrypting key can be discovered and used against the desired encrypted information."
 decryption_III_desc:0 "Brute force, as the name implies, is an extremely simplistic and straightforward method of decryption. By simply attempting every possible solution or key until you arrive at a solution with immense processing power, an encrypted message can be deciphered. It can be used on virtually all cryptosystems assuming that enough processing power is available. However, as encryption becomes more advanced, this can eventually become infeasible as higher levels of encryption may require more processing power than is reasonably available. "
 decryption_IV_desc:0 "Hacking has numerous definitions but here it references gaining unauthorized access to a computer system through the use of software. Remotely gaining access to systems by exploiting vulnerabilities in software can allow a hacker to compromise a network and gaina access to, destroy, or manipulate data within' a protected network."
 decryption_V_desc:0 "Malware is any program with malicious intent and spyware is any program which unwillingly gathers information from a host. \nWhile attempting to gather information from a host indirectly through decrypting messages is useful, it becomes infeasible as modern cryptography becomes too advanced. Instead, taking measures to breach vulnerabilities in software remotely is desirable to access the unencrypted information directly. Additionally, creating malicious software or spyware to infect a host via vulnerabilities or traps can open backdoors by themselves. "
 decryption_VI_desc:0 "An exploit kit is a collection of exploits for vulnerabilities organized in a massive catalog acting as a repository. Exploit kits contain massive numbers of exploits for virtually all vulnerabilities in virtually all versions of virtually all software targeted by an exploit kit’s maker. Doing this enables a malware creator or hacker to simply create the malware they desire and attach a functional exploit. All a malware creator needs to know is the software and versions of a piece of software that a target computer uses and they can browse the exploit kit. If the exploit kit makers have found a vulnerability and made the exploit, the malware creator merely needs to hook it and expose the target computer to it. Government-owned kits can keep vulnerabilities secret for years until they desire to launch a massive attack."

 coms_I_desc:0 "Telephones have undergone massive improvements since their first inception from Alexander Graham Bell in the 1870s. In 1878, the first commercial US telephone exchange opened in the US. In 1915, the first long-distance coast-to-coast telephone call was made. By the 1930s and 40s, telephone usage had become commonplace across the developed world and used extensively and frequently. Soon after the war, telephones had reached a level to where virtually anyone could make a directed call to anyone else and the telephone was very widely available. By the early 50s, telephones were more reliable and could communicate faster than ever."
 coms_II_desc:0 "In the early 60s, the first privately sponsored space program began. This program, sponsored by AT&T, Bell Telephone Labs, and French National PTT was intended to create the first satellite communication array. In November 22,1963, NASA’s Relay 1 transmitted the first trans-pacific signal.It would be years until enough satellites and relays were constructed before widespread commercial use could be conducted. However, the military, intelligence agencies, and business executives would be the early adopters of this new technology. Continuous investment and a rapid increase in the number of adopters led to the satellite communications project being able to continue and reach more and more people."
 coms_III_desc:0 "Dialup is a method of internet access and data transmittance that uses public switched telephone networks to establish a connection by dialing an internet provider’s telephone number on the line. The data is then communicated to the internet service provider through the telephone line. The modem encodes and decodes information to and from audio signals in order to transmit data. Dialup connections are highly efficient as they only need telephone network infrastructure to communicate information. Dialup is capable of transmitting ~50 kb/s."
 coms_IV_desc:0 "2G Communication is the 2nd generation of cellular technology. 2G networks is far more capable of complex encryption and is capable of transmitting more data. 2G enabled wireless communications to become notably more efficient than dialup reaching speeds around ~250 kb/s. In order to reach these speeds, 2G requires stronger wireless equipment, highly efficient wireless protocols, and with the implementation of 2G EDGE later on comes 8PSK encoding and circuit-switched domain standardization. "
 coms_V_desc:0 "3G Communication is the 3rd generation of cellular technology. 3G networks have much stronger penetrative capability compared to 2G and can reach farther lengths as a result. 3G networks can reach speeds of ~3mb/s. Similar to the creation of 2G, 3G requires stronger communication equipment."
 coms_VI_desc:0 "4G Communication is the 4th generation of cellular technology and a pinnacle advancement in communications that allows streaming services, high-speed internet, and smart networking. 4G networks can reach speeds of ~12.5-125mb/s, which is an important turnover for high capacity, high speed networks. Long Term Evolution (LTE) is a technical standard for wireless broadband communication that increases the speed of communications. "
