 decolonization.25.d:0 "The West Indies Federation came into existence today following the passage of the British Caribbean Federation Act. The new political union unites over twenty major islands and nearly two hundred and fifty smaller islands into ten provinces with a federal center. The British hope the Federation will be able to transition its now former colonial islands into a fully independent state. London sees the Federation as a response to the increased pressure from subjects in the islands for independence while also ensuring independence will result in a viable state not dependent on London. Some residents, especially from the larger islands cautiously welcome this new state but express anxiety to questions of how centralized the Federation will be. Some anti-colonial activists see the Federation as merely continued British exploitation and only immediate independence would end centuries of colonial oppression to the people of the islands. However, it appears most people welcome the news and hope this will mark a new period of independence and development for the people."

 decolonization.26.d:0 "The anti-colonial struggle in Portuguese Guinea and Cape Verde continued to move closer to peace. In a referendum held on Cape Verde, the island’s population overwhelmingly voted in favor of accepting an independent National Assembly presented by the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC). The other option was to reject independence from Portugal. Although violent anti-colonial activity did not occur on Cape Verde, Cape Verdeans actively participated in the conflict on the mainland and had several leading politicians operating within PAIGC. Senior party member and Cape Verdean Aristides Pereira is expected to take power once Portugal officially leaves. He served in senior positions within the PAIGC and helped organize strikes and anti-colonial protests on Cape Verde, ensuring his people were engaged in the independence struggle. The referendum reflects the Portuguese shift to embracing decolonization to resolve its conflict in Portuguese Guinea. The onlypotential stumbling block for the new state of Cape Verde is the internal debate about whether the country should seek unification with Guinea Bissau or maintain its independence."

 decolonization.27.d:0 "São Tomé and Príncipe had been a Portuguese colony since the Portuguese first arrived on the uninhabited islands in the late fifteenth century. It became a site of sugar plantations and a major slave trade center in the region. Eventually, cocoa and coffee also became major exports for the island but its history with slavery and forced labor hung a cloud over the relationship between the majority African population on the islands and Portugal. As the clamor for decolonization grew following World War II, a socialist party of São Toméans formed called the Movement for the Liberation of São Tomé and Príncipe (MLSTP). Although the MLSTP did not engage in violence, it did establish a base and advocated against Portuguese colonialism. Following the decision by Portugal to embrace decolonization, local colonial authorities engaged with the MLSTP and began a transition to independence for the islands. In a national referendum the people voted for a constituent assembly where the MLSTP won every seat, marking the end of Portuguese rule on the island. MLSTP leader Manuel Pinto da Costa is expected to become head of state for the new nation."
