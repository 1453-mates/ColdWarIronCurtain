 decolonization.25.d:0 "The West Indies Federation came into existence today following the passage of the British Caribbean Federation Act. The new political union unites over twenty major islands and nearly two hundred and fifty smaller islands into ten provinces with a federal center. The British hope the Federation will be able to transition its now former colonial islands into a fully independent state. London sees the Federation as a response to the increased pressure from subjects in the islands for independence while also ensuring independence will result in a viable state not dependent on London. Some residents, especially from the larger islands cautiously welcome this new state but express anxiety to questions of how centralized the Federation will be. Some anti-colonial activists see the Federation as merely continued British exploitation and only immediate independence would end centuries of colonial oppression to the people of the islands. However, it appears most people welcome the news and hope this will mark a new period of independence and development for the people."

 decolonization.26.d:0 "The anti-colonial struggle in Portuguese Guinea and Cape Verde continued to move closer to peace. In a referendum held on Cape Verde, the island’s population overwhelmingly voted in favor of accepting an independent National Assembly presented by the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC). The other option was to reject independence from Portugal. Although violent anti-colonial activity did not occur on Cape Verde, Cape Verdeans actively participated in the conflict on the mainland and had several leading politicians operating within PAIGC. Senior party member and Cape Verdean Aristides Pereira is expected to take power once Portugal officially leaves. He served in senior positions within the PAIGC and helped organize strikes and anti-colonial protests on Cape Verde, ensuring his people were engaged in the independence struggle. The referendum reflects the Portuguese shift to embracing decolonization to resolve its conflict in Portuguese Guinea. The onlypotential stumbling block for the new state of Cape Verde is the internal debate about whether the country should seek unification with Guinea Bissau or maintain its independence."
