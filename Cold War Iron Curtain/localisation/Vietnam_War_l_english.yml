NLF_Flavor.1.d:0 "For the communists in South Vietnam the Saigon government has failed to hold unification elections and has continued a policy of oppression against the communists. The regular bouts of political infighting in Saigon along with corruption has greatly alienated the peasants and villages located away from the cities. Recently, the North Vietnam government approved a liberation war for the South Vietnamese communists. Viet Minh cadres who stayed behind after the French withdrawal were activated. Many are now training peasants in guerrilla warfare and instructing in in communist doctrine. Others are already launching attacks on government officials in the countryside with the hopes of quickly liberating South Vietnam. The South Vietnamese government are deploying its own forces and has pledged to quickly deal with the unrest."
NLF_Flavor.2.d:0 "After the Geneva Accord, the communists and Viet Minh decided to form the National Liberation Front (NLF) to carry out the communist cause in South Vietnam. Although the Accord stipulated all Viet Minh must withdraw from the south, several thousand will be secretly left back to makeup the core of the NLF. For the moment the NLF will stay low profile, make contacts amongst the peasants and spread communist ideology among them. The NLF will also sow unrest and instability to keep the Saigon government weak. The NLF plans to setup several front organizations, including religious movements to cover their involvement and strike at Saigon from different angles. The NLF will be the vanguard of the southern revolution and lead the unification of Vietnam when the moment arrives."
Vietnam_War_Decisions_category_desc:0 "The failure for North Vietnam and South Vietnam to agree on a unification plan left the regional situation perilous. Among the South Vietnamese there were those hoping a viable government could emerge but in rural areas, there was rising discontent over political uncertainty and corruption. The North Vietnamese decided to take advantage and began training South Vietnamese communists to begin a national struggle for unification. North Vietnamese cadres are also being infiltrated to aid their allies in the south. The South Vietnamese government is organizing its own forces and supporters to crush this threat and then liberate Vietnam themselves.\n\nNational Liberation Front Funding [?NLF.global_nlf_funding]\nRepublic of Vietnam Funding [?VIE.global_vie_funding]"
