  burma.1.d:0 "Ever since achieving independence from Britain in 1948, our country has been plagued by political turmoil and civil strife, including multiple Communist insurgencies and the ruling AFPFL party splitting into two competing factions. Whilst we have managed to keep our nation together, the latest danger to the government appears to be the military, who we have come to rely on to maintain order over the years, and relations with them have been tense ever since they accepted the rule of the civilian government two years ago. In a sudden and unexpected turn of events, military commander Ne Win has orchestrated a nationwide military coup against our government. Army divisions have already seized strategic positions in Rangoon and are cementing their grip over the country, with their goal seemingly being to end democracy and return Burma to a one-party military dictatorship. However, it may not be too late to act and make an attempt to restore order to the country."

 SAU_Focus_Events_1_d:0 "The Saudi government announced the death of King Ibn Saud today. The founder of the modern Saudi state passed away from a heart attack overnight in his palace in Ta'if. Ibn Saud was born in 1875 to the ruler of Nedj. However, in his teenage years he and his family fled as exiles when his family rival's the Rashidis conquered Nedj. By 1902, Ibn Saud led a band of relatives and followers to re-conquer his family's hometown of Riyadh. This led to a campaign against the Rashidis which saw Ibn Saud successfully liberate his family's homeland while driving the Ottomans out of the region. He embraced the ancient alliance between his family and the Wahabi sect. With Wahabi support in the form of a unifying ideology and devoted fighters Ibn Saud was able to eventually conquer the Rashidis in 1922. He solidified his position as a world leader by conquering the Hejaz from the Hashimites in 1925 and in 1932 he proclaimed the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. His control of the annual Hajj pilgrimage gave him and Wahabism prestige across the Muslim world, but the discovery of crude oil in the late 1930s would provide unprecedented wealth for the kingdom. Ibn Saud used Wahabism to unite the tribes of Arabia and oil wealth allowed him to offer subsidies to secure loyalty from his subjects. His impressive military victories were combined with tact diplomacy as he navigated regional tensions and secured a close partnership with the United States. Questions will be asked if his successors can maintain the Saudi alliance with the Wahabis and if they will continue to court American support to ensure they will be protected from threats to the kingdom both external and internal. Prince Saud, his son is considered the favorite to take the throne."	
 SAU_Focus_Events.2.d:0 "Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Saud was coronated earlier today in Saudi Arabia. He has the tremendous responsibility of succeeding his father, the legendary King Ibn Saud who founded the modern Saudi state. Where his father united a kingdom of Bedouin chieftains, the new King Saud must contend with regional instability, ideological threats, and international intrigue. Saudi Arabia controls huge oil reserves and the Saudi king must content with much more than just organizing the annual pilgrimage and securing loyalty from his subjects. In addition relations with the Wahabi ulema must continue to be preserved and nurtured as losing their support risks major internal instability. In his opening speech to his people and the world at large, the new King announced a new Council of Ministers. In addition, he said his reign will not be focused on military conflict but on ending poverty, expanding education, healthcare, securing a strong military for defense, and on implementing Sharia to all within the kingdom. King Saud had long been appointment crown prince and was well-prepared by his father to rule as a desert ruler of Arabia. However, some worry handling the country's growing oil wealth and dealing with the different ideologies flourishing in the Arab world may be too much for the new King. Time will tell whether the new king can rise to the challenge he faces in a world vastly different from the one he grew up with."	
 SAU_Focus_Events.3.d:0 "Following the coronation of King Saud, Prince Faisal took over as crown prince to his brother the king. Prince Faisal served administrative posts, as a military leader for his father King Ibn Saud, and has extensive diplomatic experience as the Saudi foreign minister. King Saud's ambitious projects and extravagant spending has led to financial problems and public discomfort to the government. In addition, radio broadcasts from Arab nationalist states denouncing the old Arab monarchies have gained increasing popularity among segments of the population. Fearing the current wave of Arab nationalism and growing public anger at government spending has led a faction of the ulema and royal family to band together. They have confronted King Saud and have demanded he place Prince Faisal to the post of Prime Minister with executive powers. Reluctantly, the King has agreed and Faisal has become Prime Minister. Diplomats in Riyadh believe this may curtail the King's more impulsive decisions but there is little doubt the brothers will clash and it is highly possible that instead of acting as a check to the king's power this may instead lead to larger infighting within the Saudi royal family. Only time will tell whether this appointment can restore Saudi prestige."		
 SAU_Focus_Events.4.d:0 "In shocking developments today, members of the Saudi Air Force have taken control of Riyadh. They have seized major government. Military, transportation, and media facilities and are said to have much of the royal family under armed guard. Military fighters bombed palaces and military sites leading to fears that the royal family has suffered big losses. From state radio the Saudi coup leaders announced the end of a decadent regime and the birth of a new Arab Republic in Riyadh. Radio Cairo has reacted to glee at this coup as President Nasser long declared the liberation of the Arab World would first have to begin with the liberation of Riyadh. Urban middle-class Saudis are said to be happy with these developments but rural Saudi citizens, especially the Arab chieftains may not take this change peacefully. There are rumors that Prince Talal may be coming back to Saudi Arabia and indeed may already be there. He had led many young princes to Egypt in support of Nasser following the Egyptian Revolution and his faction of the royal family may help the transition of Saudi Arabia to an Arab Republic as he long advocated transitioning Saudi Arabia into a constitutional government. The United States embassy is surrounded as Washington struggles to comprehend what has occurred in what it sees as one of the most critical states in the world. The rest of the world is also watching these developments closely as the Saudis have long been guardians of the Islamic holy lands and their control of global oil reserves may effect energy prices. For Nasser, a friendly regime in Saudi Arabia can transform the regional balance of power, leaving Saudi Arabia's monarchical neighbors in a mood of panic."	
 SAU_Focus_Events.5.d:0 "Saudi Arabia today announced it had arrested dozens of Air Force personnel who were plotting to overthrow the Saudi state. Many more arrests are expected to follow in the aftermath. The government had long suspected Nasserists had infiltrated the military and the urban middle-class. The government said the plotters were about to launch a putsch that would see Riyadh taken over and air raids on key government facilities. President Nasser, through Radio Cairo had long advocated that the liberation of the Arab World would begin with the liberation of Riyadh and the breakup of this plot will no doubt be a great blow to his regional objectives. The failure of the coup will no doubt push the Saudi government to strengthen oversight on the military and increase its paranoia. Prince Talal and the young princes who have long been sympathetic to Nasser and a transition to a constitutional government will be under much greater scrutiny by the Saudi King. The United States will be breathing a sigh of relief that it helped prevent the fall of a critical ally in the region."	
 SAU_Focus_Events.6.d:0 "In the aftermath of the successful Saudi Free Officer coup a revolutionary fervor has swept supporters of the revolutionaries. These supporters have taken to the street to cheer on military units and throw rocks at palaces and officers associated with the royal family. Many prominent Saudi princes have been detained in these facilities under the watch of their personal bodyguards. However, in recent hours, mid-level Saudi military officers from the Free Officer movement have been moving house to house with armed contingents. Most of the princes' households' bodyguards either surrendered or were overpowered by the armed troops. Once the officers took control of the palaces, the princes and their households were dragged out of their homes and executed either in the courtyard of the palaces or out on the streets. Those princes killed on the streets had their bodies dragged and desecrated by the roving mobs. The Free Officer Movement announced the deaths of many prominent princes and declared these deaths were the natural expression of a people long chained by a decadent ruling class. Considering how the Saudi state had been run through the royal family and its many princes, these executions are a way for the revolutionaries to decapitate the old political class and pave the way for a new order. While Nasserists see these actions as necessary, those Arab states which were ideologically close with the Saudi Royal family are said to be infuriated by the actions."
 SAU_Focus_Events.7.d:0 "Around 15,000 workers in the Saudi oil industry joined a strike for better working conditions. The Saudi King has ordered a royal commission of inquiry as this marks a radical transformation in labor-relations in the kingdom. Saudi workers were said to be inspired by foreign Arab workers who pointed out their poor conditions in comparison to the vastly superior conditions their American managers enjoy in the kingdom. The bad conditions and refusal for ARAMCO to meet worker demands has driven anti-Americans as the workers believed the American-owned company's actions reflected what the United States thought of the workers. Also radicalizing the workers into striking has been recent inflation and anger at opulent spending by the royal family. To coordinate the strike, a workers' committee has been established and the unity of Saudi workers beyond tribal bonds is seen as a major threat to the Saudi royal family. The Saudi King will have to decide on whether to give in to the worker demands, offer a few concessions, or reject the worker demands. Giving in to all the demands may make the workers happy but embolden them to make more demands and empower the influence of foreign workers. In addition, the United States will not be happy if ARAMCO loses the strike. Supporting ARAMCO and rejecting the workers will help our standing with the United States but infuriate the workers, so perhaps a compromise will be the best route. In the long-term the government must consider how to control the influence of foreign labor on the citizens of Saudi Arabia."	
 SAU_Focus_Events.8.d:0 "The British and United States have strongly pressured the Saudi government to join the newly created Central Treaty Organization (CENTO), also called the Baghdad Pact. The alliance brought Iraq, Turkey, Iran, Pakistan and the United Kingdom together in an anti-communist regional pact. The British strongly believe having the Saudis would solidify the alliance's legitimacy among the monarchical Arab states. However, after careful consideration, the Saudi government announced the King refused to join. The Saudi government argues it cannot support or join any regional alliances or blocks which further foreign agendas. Doing so would inevitably lead to unacceptable inter-Arab conflicts and hurt regional tranquility. Privately, reporters in Riyadh were told by government sources the Saudi government had another issue with the alliance. The Saudi government was not too keen about joining an alliance that included the Hashemite state of Iraq as the Hashemite and Saudi families were historical rivals. Also the Saudi leadership felt a Western backed, anti-communist alliance in the region would provoke a counter-bloc to be formed by either the Soviet Union or Egypt that would inevitably lead to conflict."		
 SAU_Focus_Events.9.d:0 "Strong lobbying in Riyadh by American and British diplomats led to a major breakthrough today. The Saudi Arabian government released a statement stating the King intended to join the newly created Central Treaty Organization (CENTO), also called the Baghdad Pact. Saudi Arabia joins the anti-communist regional pact, which already includes Iraq, Turkey, Iran, Pakistan and the United Kingdom. The Saudi government calculates that CENTO ensures the spread of radical leftist politics in the region and republican pan-Arabism will be curtailed by the alliance. By joining with Hashemite Iraq, it appears the historical rivalry between the two royal dynasties has been resolved. Although some diplomats in the region privately state this rivalry may unravel the alliance from within. For the alliance, adding the Saudis makes CENTO more legitimate in the region. Saudi Arabia and Egypt have been engaged in a struggle for influence in the Arab World. Already radio broadcasts from Egypt have denounced the Saudi decision and calls on Arab masses across the region to take the streets and demand their nations boycott CENTO. With Saudi Arabia onboard, the United States and United Kingdom hope that Arab states sympathetic to Saudi Arabia may also follow suit. Increasingly CENTO appears to be turning into an Islamic NATO."		
 SAU_Focus_Events.10.d:0 "The Saudi Arabian government released a statement announcing the appointment of Prince Talal as the Prime Minister of Saudi Arabia. King Saud has faced immense pressure in recent months over public discontent with his public spending and the rising threat of pan-Arab nationalism being propagated by Egypt and their Nasserist sympathizers across the region. The traditionalist faction within the royal family were said to be pushing the King to appoint a Prime Minister with executive power to control the situation. The choice of Prince Talal raises many eyebrows in Western capitals. Prince Talal leads a faction of princes who are pro-Nasser and advocate a far more liberal line than the traditionalist faction. Prince Talal openly advocates major political reforms and the establishment of a constitution for Saudi Arabia. King Saud appears to have appointed Talal in order to counter-balance the influence of their brother Prince Faisal, who enjoys support from the traditionalists. King Saud also hopes Prince Talal's advocacy of a transition to constitutional governance will take the wind out of those advocating revolution within the kingdom along the Nasserist lines. More importantly, this move appears to have taken the wind out of the traditionalist faction which pushed the king to appoint a Prime Minister. Ultimately, the question will be if Prince Talal can manage his relationship with the king, the traditionalists, especially the Wahabi ulema, and managing expectations as a failure to deliver political reforms may end up further radicalizing a frustrated population. Time will tell if this appointment marks the beginning of a gradual democratic transformation for the kingdom."		
 SAU_Focus_Events.11.d:0 "In Riyadh today, the Republic of Arabia formally joined the United Arab Republic (UAR). In a formal but lavish ceremony. With representatives from friendly governments, senior Republic of Arabia leaders, and representatives from all UAR member states were present. In the conclusion of the ceremony, the UAR president accepted the Republic of Arabia's request to join. As the two men embraced on stage, the assembled guests thundered in applause. This move radically transforms the Middle East. The UAR, through the Republic of Arabia, now controls one of the most valuable resources on the planet in oil. The UAR's rivals for influence in the Arab World are now at a strategic disadvantage as the balance of power has permanently shifted. Both the United States and Soviet Union must contend with the UAR as a rising power. However, with the arrival of the Republic of Arabia, there are some experts who believe this fundamental regional shift also marks a fundamental shift within the UAR. Egypt has long dominated the United Arab Republic but with the Republic of Arabia's economic power and symbolic status as the host of the Islamic holy land, Egyptian domination appears vulnerable. Especially if other member states begin working together. While the UAR celebrates its continued expansion and rival states look on in fear, time will tell if this great experiment in Arab nationalism will continue to march onward."		
 SAU_Focus_Events.12.d:0 "King Ibn Saud, the founder of Saudi Arabia united Arabia with the sword and a close ideological alliance with the Wahabi ulema. Since then the kingdom has been run by the royal family working in conjunction with the ulema to ensure all laws obey God's. In recent years however, the popularity of pan-Arabism espoused by President Gamal Nasser of Egypt has spread across the Arab World. The royal family is not immune to this influence. A number of ideological young princes have united under the leadership of Prince Talal and call themselves the Free Princes, in homage to Nasser's Free Officers. These young princes have rallied around Prince Talal who often brings up the need for more democratic reforms and a constitution to senior members of the family. However, the King and senior ulema no longer have patience with the Free Princes. They are called subversive, secret communists, and in some quarters are viewed as anti-Islam in their push for reforms that challenge the Islamic character of the state. Some have had their assets frozen and most of the Free Princes have fled the country in fear of persecution from the government. Many have arrived in Lebanon and Egypt. The Egyptians are expected to start using prominent princes, especially Prince Talal to broadcast messages against the Saudi state. Although the Free Princes will raise mischief abroad, at least they will not foment unrest within not just the kingdom but the royal family itself."	
 SAU_Focus_Events.13.d:0 "The Saudi Arabian government announced through a statement from the King that it strongly condemned Britain's naked aggression against the people of Egypt. The British long exhibited an arrogant and imperialist attitude towards the Suez. Egypt consistently sought a just resolution while Britain continuously showed no interest in treating the people of Egypt fairly. Instead, the King's statement added, the British plotted with  Egypt's sworn enemies to launch a barbaric attack. The Saudi government would stand with the people of Egypt and called for Arab unity in this time of crisis. To support the Egyptians, the Saudi government additionally announced an oil embargo on aggressor states that would last until the violence against Egypt halted. Although Egypt's revolutionary government appears to be the opposite of the Saudi monarchical state, the two state's shared animosity to the Hashemite dynasty in Jordan appears to unite them. In addition, the Saudis enjoy close ties with the United States and are following their lead in this crisis. Taking a stand against the British will help the Egyptians but pressure the Jordanian government and King who has long been dependent on British support to rule. In issuing this strong stance, Saudi Arabia has once again shown itself as one of the principal leaders of the Arab World."	
 SAU_Focus_Events.14.d:0 "The Saudi government condemned Britain's continued occupation of Aden and decried how colonialism continued to shackle Arabs to Western occupation. The wave of decolonization and rise of Arab nationalism across the Middle East has left many to see Aden as an outpost of an archaic system. For the British, Aden served historically as a key coaling station, anti-piracy base, and trade outpost since the nineteenth century. The amount of trade which passes through the port along with its strategic position as a key component of the British global defense network makes the British hesitant to give up its control of Aden. In addition, Aden oil production is seen as a critical strategic asset. The British see efforts by the Saudis and Egyptians to push them out of Aden as an effort to secure Aden as space to be incorporated by either state or their proxies. For the Saudis, challenging British colonialism helps its reputation across the Arab world but more importantly, it puts pressure on the British to leave. A British withdrawal from Aden would no doubt be a great Arab achievement, but also a potential opportunity for the Saudi state."
