  burma.1.d:0 "Ever since achieving independence from Britain in 1948, our country has been plagued by political turmoil and civil strife, including multiple Communist insurgencies and the ruling AFPFL party splitting into two competing factions. Whilst we have managed to keep our nation together, the latest danger to the government appears to be the military, who we have come to rely on to maintain order over the years, and relations with them have been tense ever since they accepted the rule of the civilian government two years ago. In a sudden and unexpected turn of events, military commander Ne Win has orchestrated a nationwide military coup against our government. Army divisions have already seized strategic positions in Rangoon and are cementing their grip over the country, with their goal seemingly being to end democracy and return Burma to a one-party military dictatorship. However, it may not be too late to act and make an attempt to restore order to the country."
