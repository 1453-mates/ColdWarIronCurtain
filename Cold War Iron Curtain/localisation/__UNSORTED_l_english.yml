  burma.1.d:0 "Ever since achieving independence from Britain in 1948, our country has been plagued by political turmoil and civil strife, including multiple Communist insurgencies and the ruling AFPFL party splitting into two competing factions. Whilst we have managed to keep our nation together, the latest danger to the government appears to be the military, who we have come to rely on to maintain order over the years, and relations with them have been tense ever since they accepted the rule of the civilian government two years ago. In a sudden and unexpected turn of events, military commander Ne Win has orchestrated a nationwide military coup against our government. Army divisions have already seized strategic positions in Rangoon and are cementing their grip over the country, with their goal seemingly being to end democracy and return Burma to a one-party military dictatorship. However, it may not be too late to act and make an attempt to restore order to the country."

The Immigration Restriction Bill was one of the first Bills introduced to the new parliament and proposed a twofold approach to restricting non-white population growth. The Act came into law on 23 December 1901, formally representing the establishment of the ‘White Australian Policy`The Act gave immigration officers the power to make any non-European migrant sit a 50-word dictation test. This was initially given in any European language, and after 1905 in any prescribed language.Small numbers of migrants were granted certificates of exemption from the test but often exempted people became separated from their friends and family members who did not pass and were deported.The introduction of two accompanying acts (the Pacific Island Labourers Act 1901 and the Post and Telegraph Act 1901) further limited access to Australia for non-white migrants by outlawing the use of imported labour and making it mandatory to hire white workers on any vessels transporting Australian mail."

 SAU_Focus_Events_1_d:0 "The Saudi government announced the death of King Ibn Saud today. The founder of the modern Saudi state passed away from a heart attack overnight in his palace in Ta'if. Ibn Saud was born in 1875 to the ruler of Nedj. However, in his teenage years he and his family fled as exiles when his family rival's the Rashidis conquered Nedj. By 1902, Ibn Saud led a band of relatives and followers to re-conquer his family's hometown of Riyadh. This led to a campaign against the Rashidis which saw Ibn Saud successfully liberate his family's homeland while driving the Ottomans out of the region. He embraced the ancient alliance between his family and the Wahabi sect. With Wahabi support in the form of a unifying ideology and devoted fighters Ibn Saud was able to eventually conquer the Rashidis in 1922. He solidified his position as a world leader by conquering the Hejaz from the Hashimites in 1925 and in 1932 he proclaimed the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. His control of the annual Hajj pilgrimage gave him and Wahabism prestige across the Muslim world, but the discovery of crude oil in the late 1930s would provide unprecedented wealth for the kingdom. Ibn Saud used Wahabism to unite the tribes of Arabia and oil wealth allowed him to offer subsidies to secure loyalty from his subjects. His impressive military victories were combined with tact diplomacy as he navigated regional tensions and secured a close partnership with the United States. Questions will be asked if his successors can maintain the Saudi alliance with the Wahabis and if they will continue to court American support to ensure they will be protected from threats to the kingdom both external and internal. Prince Saud, his son is considered the favorite to take the throne."	
 SAU_Focus_Events.2.d:0 "Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Saud was coronated earlier today in Saudi Arabia. He has the tremendous responsibility of succeeding his father, the legendary King Ibn Saud who founded the modern Saudi state. Where his father united a kingdom of Bedouin chieftains, the new King Saud must contend with regional instability, ideological threats, and international intrigue. Saudi Arabia controls huge oil reserves and the Saudi king must content with much more than just organizing the annual pilgrimage and securing loyalty from his subjects. In addition relations with the Wahabi ulema must continue to be preserved and nurtured as losing their support risks major internal instability. In his opening speech to his people and the world at large, the new King announced a new Council of Ministers. In addition, he said his reign will not be focused on military conflict but on ending poverty, expanding education, healthcare, securing a strong military for defense, and on implementing Sharia to all within the kingdom. King Saud had long been appointment crown prince and was well-prepared by his father to rule as a desert ruler of Arabia. However, some worry handling the country's growing oil wealth and dealing with the different ideologies flourishing in the Arab world may be too much for the new King. Time will tell whether the new king can rise to the challenge he faces in a world vastly different from the one he grew up with."	
 SAU_Focus_Events.3.d:0 "Following the coronation of King Saud, Prince Faisal took over as crown prince to his brother the king. Prince Faisal served administrative posts, as a military leader for his father King Ibn Saud, and has extensive diplomatic experience as the Saudi foreign minister. King Saud's ambitious projects and extravagant spending has led to financial problems and public discomfort to the government. In addition, radio broadcasts from Arab nationalist states denouncing the old Arab monarchies have gained increasing popularity among segments of the population. Fearing the current wave of Arab nationalism and growing public anger at government spending has led a faction of the ulema and royal family to band together. They have confronted King Saud and have demanded he place Prince Faisal to the post of Prime Minister with executive powers. Reluctantly, the King has agreed and Faisal has become Prime Minister. Diplomats in Riyadh believe this may curtail the King's more impulsive decisions but there is little doubt the brothers will clash and it is highly possible that instead of acting as a check to the king's power this may instead lead to larger infighting within the Saudi royal family. Only time will tell whether this appointment can restore Saudi prestige."		
 SAU_Focus_Events.4.d:0 "In shocking developments today, members of the Saudi Air Force have taken control of Riyadh. They have seized major government. Military, transportation, and media facilities and are said to have much of the royal family under armed guard. Military fighters bombed palaces and military sites leading to fears that the royal family has suffered big losses. From state radio the Saudi coup leaders announced the end of a decadent regime and the birth of a new Arab Republic in Riyadh. Radio Cairo has reacted to glee at this coup as President Nasser long declared the liberation of the Arab World would first have to begin with the liberation of Riyadh. Urban middle-class Saudis are said to be happy with these developments but rural Saudi citizens, especially the Arab chieftains may not take this change peacefully. There are rumors that Prince Talal may be coming back to Saudi Arabia and indeed may already be there. He had led many young princes to Egypt in support of Nasser following the Egyptian Revolution and his faction of the royal family may help the transition of Saudi Arabia to an Arab Republic as he long advocated transitioning Saudi Arabia into a constitutional government. The United States embassy is surrounded as Washington struggles to comprehend what has occurred in what it sees as one of the most critical states in the world. The rest of the world is also watching these developments closely as the Saudis have long been guardians of the Islamic holy lands and their control of global oil reserves may effect energy prices. For Nasser, a friendly regime in Saudi Arabia can transform the regional balance of power, leaving Saudi Arabia's monarchical neighbors in a mood of panic."	
 SAU_Focus_Events.5.d:0 "Saudi Arabia today announced it had arrested dozens of Air Force personnel who were plotting to overthrow the Saudi state. Many more arrests are expected to follow in the aftermath. The government had long suspected Nasserists had infiltrated the military and the urban middle-class. The government said the plotters were about to launch a putsch that would see Riyadh taken over and air raids on key government facilities. President Nasser, through Radio Cairo had long advocated that the liberation of the Arab World would begin with the liberation of Riyadh and the breakup of this plot will no doubt be a great blow to his regional objectives. The failure of the coup will no doubt push the Saudi government to strengthen oversight on the military and increase its paranoia. Prince Talal and the young princes who have long been sympathetic to Nasser and a transition to a constitutional government will be under much greater scrutiny by the Saudi King. The United States will be breathing a sigh of relief that it helped prevent the fall of a critical ally in the region."	
 SAU_Focus_Events.6.d:0 "In the aftermath of the successful Saudi Free Officer coup a revolutionary fervor has swept supporters of the revolutionaries. These supporters have taken to the street to cheer on military units and throw rocks at palaces and officers associated with the royal family. Many prominent Saudi princes have been detained in these facilities under the watch of their personal bodyguards. However, in recent hours, mid-level Saudi military officers from the Free Officer movement have been moving house to house with armed contingents. Most of the princes' households' bodyguards either surrendered or were overpowered by the armed troops. Once the officers took control of the palaces, the princes and their households were dragged out of their homes and executed either in the courtyard of the palaces or out on the streets. Those princes killed on the streets had their bodies dragged and desecrated by the roving mobs. The Free Officer Movement announced the deaths of many prominent princes and declared these deaths were the natural expression of a people long chained by a decadent ruling class. Considering how the Saudi state had been run through the royal family and its many princes, these executions are a way for the revolutionaries to decapitate the old political class and pave the way for a new order. While Nasserists see these actions as necessary, those Arab states which were ideologically close with the Saudi Royal family are said to be infuriated by the actions."
 SAU_Focus_Events.7.d:0 "Around 15,000 workers in the Saudi oil industry joined a strike for better working conditions. The Saudi King has ordered a royal commission of inquiry as this marks a radical transformation in labor-relations in the kingdom. Saudi workers were said to be inspired by foreign Arab workers who pointed out their poor conditions in comparison to the vastly superior conditions their American managers enjoy in the kingdom. The bad conditions and refusal for ARAMCO to meet worker demands has driven anti-Americans as the workers believed the American-owned company's actions reflected what the United States thought of the workers. Also radicalizing the workers into striking has been recent inflation and anger at opulent spending by the royal family. To coordinate the strike, a workers' committee has been established and the unity of Saudi workers beyond tribal bonds is seen as a major threat to the Saudi royal family. The Saudi King will have to decide on whether to give in to the worker demands, offer a few concessions, or reject the worker demands. Giving in to all the demands may make the workers happy but embolden them to make more demands and empower the influence of foreign workers. In addition, the United States will not be happy if ARAMCO loses the strike. Supporting ARAMCO and rejecting the workers will help our standing with the United States but infuriate the workers, so perhaps a compromise will be the best route. In the long-term the government must consider how to control the influence of foreign labor on the citizens of Saudi Arabia."	
 SAU_Focus_Events.8.d:0 "The British and United States have strongly pressured the Saudi government to join the newly created Central Treaty Organization (CENTO), also called the Baghdad Pact. The alliance brought Iraq, Turkey, Iran, Pakistan and the United Kingdom together in an anti-communist regional pact. The British strongly believe having the Saudis would solidify the alliance's legitimacy among the monarchical Arab states. However, after careful consideration, the Saudi government announced the King refused to join. The Saudi government argues it cannot support or join any regional alliances or blocks which further foreign agendas. Doing so would inevitably lead to unacceptable inter-Arab conflicts and hurt regional tranquility. Privately, reporters in Riyadh were told by government sources the Saudi government had another issue with the alliance. The Saudi government was not too keen about joining an alliance that included the Hashemite state of Iraq as the Hashemite and Saudi families were historical rivals. Also the Saudi leadership felt a Western backed, anti-communist alliance in the region would provoke a counter-bloc to be formed by either the Soviet Union or Egypt that would inevitably lead to conflict."		
 SAU_Focus_Events.9.d:0 "Strong lobbying in Riyadh by American and British diplomats led to a major breakthrough today. The Saudi Arabian government released a statement stating the King intended to join the newly created Central Treaty Organization (CENTO), also called the Baghdad Pact. Saudi Arabia joins the anti-communist regional pact, which already includes Iraq, Turkey, Iran, Pakistan and the United Kingdom. The Saudi government calculates that CENTO ensures the spread of radical leftist politics in the region and republican pan-Arabism will be curtailed by the alliance. By joining with Hashemite Iraq, it appears the historical rivalry between the two royal dynasties has been resolved. Although some diplomats in the region privately state this rivalry may unravel the alliance from within. For the alliance, adding the Saudis makes CENTO more legitimate in the region. Saudi Arabia and Egypt have been engaged in a struggle for influence in the Arab World. Already radio broadcasts from Egypt have denounced the Saudi decision and calls on Arab masses across the region to take the streets and demand their nations boycott CENTO. With Saudi Arabia onboard, the United States and United Kingdom hope that Arab states sympathetic to Saudi Arabia may also follow suit. Increasingly CENTO appears to be turning into an Islamic NATO."		
 SAU_Focus_Events.10.d:0 "The Saudi Arabian government released a statement announcing the appointment of Prince Talal as the Prime Minister of Saudi Arabia. King Saud has faced immense pressure in recent months over public discontent with his public spending and the rising threat of pan-Arab nationalism being propagated by Egypt and their Nasserist sympathizers across the region. The traditionalist faction within the royal family were said to be pushing the King to appoint a Prime Minister with executive power to control the situation. The choice of Prince Talal raises many eyebrows in Western capitals. Prince Talal leads a faction of princes who are pro-Nasser and advocate a far more liberal line than the traditionalist faction. Prince Talal openly advocates major political reforms and the establishment of a constitution for Saudi Arabia. King Saud appears to have appointed Talal in order to counter-balance the influence of their brother Prince Faisal, who enjoys support from the traditionalists. King Saud also hopes Prince Talal's advocacy of a transition to constitutional governance will take the wind out of those advocating revolution within the kingdom along the Nasserist lines. More importantly, this move appears to have taken the wind out of the traditionalist faction which pushed the king to appoint a Prime Minister. Ultimately, the question will be if Prince Talal can manage his relationship with the king, the traditionalists, especially the Wahabi ulema, and managing expectations as a failure to deliver political reforms may end up further radicalizing a frustrated population. Time will tell if this appointment marks the beginning of a gradual democratic transformation for the kingdom."		
 SAU_Focus_Events.11.d:0 "In Riyadh today, the Republic of Arabia formally joined the United Arab Republic (UAR). In a formal but lavish ceremony. With representatives from friendly governments, senior Republic of Arabia leaders, and representatives from all UAR member states were present. In the conclusion of the ceremony, the UAR president accepted the Republic of Arabia's request to join. As the two men embraced on stage, the assembled guests thundered in applause. This move radically transforms the Middle East. The UAR, through the Republic of Arabia, now controls one of the most valuable resources on the planet in oil. The UAR's rivals for influence in the Arab World are now at a strategic disadvantage as the balance of power has permanently shifted. Both the United States and Soviet Union must contend with the UAR as a rising power. However, with the arrival of the Republic of Arabia, there are some experts who believe this fundamental regional shift also marks a fundamental shift within the UAR. Egypt has long dominated the United Arab Republic but with the Republic of Arabia's economic power and symbolic status as the host of the Islamic holy land, Egyptian domination appears vulnerable. Especially if other member states begin working together. While the UAR celebrates its continued expansion and rival states look on in fear, time will tell if this great experiment in Arab nationalism will continue to march onward."		
 SAU_Focus_Events.12.d:0 "King Ibn Saud, the founder of Saudi Arabia united Arabia with the sword and a close ideological alliance with the Wahabi ulema. Since then the kingdom has been run by the royal family working in conjunction with the ulema to ensure all laws obey God's. In recent years however, the popularity of pan-Arabism espoused by President Gamal Nasser of Egypt has spread across the Arab World. The royal family is not immune to this influence. A number of ideological young princes have united under the leadership of Prince Talal and call themselves the Free Princes, in homage to Nasser's Free Officers. These young princes have rallied around Prince Talal who often brings up the need for more democratic reforms and a constitution to senior members of the family. However, the King and senior ulema no longer have patience with the Free Princes. They are called subversive, secret communists, and in some quarters are viewed as anti-Islam in their push for reforms that challenge the Islamic character of the state. Some have had their assets frozen and most of the Free Princes have fled the country in fear of persecution from the government. Many have arrived in Lebanon and Egypt. The Egyptians are expected to start using prominent princes, especially Prince Talal to broadcast messages against the Saudi state. Although the Free Princes will raise mischief abroad, at least they will not foment unrest within not just the kingdom but the royal family itself."	
 SAU_Focus_Events.13.d:0 "The Saudi Arabian government announced through a statement from the King that it strongly condemned Britain's naked aggression against the people of Egypt. The British long exhibited an arrogant and imperialist attitude towards the Suez. Egypt consistently sought a just resolution while Britain continuously showed no interest in treating the people of Egypt fairly. Instead, the King's statement added, the British plotted with  Egypt's sworn enemies to launch a barbaric attack. The Saudi government would stand with the people of Egypt and called for Arab unity in this time of crisis. To support the Egyptians, the Saudi government additionally announced an oil embargo on aggressor states that would last until the violence against Egypt halted. Although Egypt's revolutionary government appears to be the opposite of the Saudi monarchical state, the two state's shared animosity to the Hashemite dynasty in Jordan appears to unite them. In addition, the Saudis enjoy close ties with the United States and are following their lead in this crisis. Taking a stand against the British will help the Egyptians but pressure the Jordanian government and King who has long been dependent on British support to rule. In issuing this strong stance, Saudi Arabia has once again shown itself as one of the principal leaders of the Arab World."	
 SAU_Focus_Events.14.d:0 "The Saudi government condemned Britain's continued occupation of Aden and decried how colonialism continued to shackle Arabs to Western occupation. The wave of decolonization and rise of Arab nationalism across the Middle East has left many to see Aden as an outpost of an archaic system. For the British, Aden served historically as a key coaling station, anti-piracy base, and trade outpost since the nineteenth century. The amount of trade which passes through the port along with its strategic position as a key component of the British global defense network makes the British hesitant to give up its control of Aden. In addition, Aden oil production is seen as a critical strategic asset. The British see efforts by the Saudis and Egyptians to push them out of Aden as an effort to secure Aden as space to be incorporated by either state or their proxies. For the Saudis, challenging British colonialism helps its reputation across the Arab world but more importantly, it puts pressure on the British to leave. A British withdrawal from Aden would no doubt be a great Arab achievement, but also a potential opportunity for the Saudi state."	

 #Need New Iraqi Event YML
 IRQ.9901.d:0 "The Hashemites have had a long and historical relationship with the Hijaz. The family traces its ancestry to the Prophet and the early Hashimites competed with other factions for the title of Caliph. Within three centuries of Islam`s founding, the title of Sharif and Emir of Mecca was given to the Hashimites. The dynasty oversaw the holy land and preserved it for the whole Islamic world. During World War I, Hussein bin Ali and his four sons revolted against the decadent Ottoman Empire after receiving promises from the British it would support a new Arab empire with a Hashimite caliph. These promises were not kept but after the war the Hashimites did establish kingdoms in Jordan, Iraq, and the Hijaz. However, in 1925 the Saudis drove the Hashimites out of their ancestral home in Hijaz. Now the Saudis appear weak, opposition to their rule grows and Hashimite loyalists still in the holy land have started a revolt to end Saudi rule. The Saudi policies of destroying historical relics and undermining the traditional powerbases of Arabia have resulted in a backlash for those who wish for the Hashimites to return. The rebels have appealed to the Hashimite powers of Iraq and Jordan for support. Both are expected to offer arms, volunteers, and diplomatic support. Both rulers have long desired to avenge the humiliation their family suffered in 1925. Saudi arrogance and disrespect for the traditions of Arabia will now cost them as the people flock to restore Hashimite rule."				#The Saudi Civil War
 IRQ.1753.d:0 "Iraq is perhaps the most arbitrarily designed state that emerged from World War I. The British merged three distinct Ottoman provinces to create Iraq. The new state lacked ethnic, religious, or linguistic homogeneity. The Arab majority was divided into Sunnis and Shias. The country had a sizable Kurdish minority concentrated in the north. A sizable Assyrian Christian population existed along with a large Jewish community in Baghdad. The British sought to rule Iraq through treaties with a friendly government to secure its interests and avoid expenses. Faisal ibn Hussein, recently deposed by the French in Syria, was brought by the British to become King Faisal I of Iraq. Despite lacking any connection to the land, King Faisal I proved adept at mediating Iraq`s factions and establishing the legitimacy of his dynasty with the people. His death in 1933 brought the inept King Ghazi to the throne. After King Ghazi`s death in 1939, the three-year-old King Faisal II took over but power rests with the regent, Prince Abdullah. King Faisal I`s early death saw parliament dominated by aging Ottoman-era politicians who constantly rotate power in parliament. The military has overthrown several premiers since Prince Abdullah's regency began, though they have chosen to not overthrow the system.  World War II witnessed the Hashemite`s biggest challenge as nationalist army officers seized power. The Hashemites and parliament returned to power only after a British invasion, forever tainting the Hashemite state in the eyes of an increasingly nationalistic population.  The Iraqi state's centralizing policy saw brutal repression as the army suppressed the Kurds and Assyrians. In addition to resistance to centralization, the anti-colonial middle class and leftist agitation among urban workers are all emerging threats to the Hashemite Iraqi state. Time will tell if King Faisal II can end the political uncertainty and restore the people`s trust in the dynasty."				
 IRQ.9998.d:0 "Frustration and anger towards the political repression in Iraq and British interference has boiled over to protests and strikes against the monarchy and the 1948 Anglo-Iraqi Treaty. For far too long, the protestors believe, Iraq has had its foreign policy dictated by London while the Hashemite dynasty curtailed any expressions of political discourse. In the midst of this unrest, King Faisal II published a public denouncement against the Constitution Party. He says the party has fanned the protestors anger and has sought to provoke a civil war in the name of its own political gains. He says in reality much of what the protestors are complaining about are actually caused by the Constitution Party and because the protests are targeting the royal family, the Constitution Party refuses to help calm the unrest. This condemnation of the Constitution Party has surprised many in Iraq and it remains to be seen if the King`s effort to place the blame and responsibility on the Party will aid its ability to calm down the unrest sweeping Iraq."		 
 IRQ.9999.d:0 "The Iraq Central League consists of football teams from clubs and institutions based across Baghdad. Despite being one of four regional leagues in the country, the Iraqi Central League is considered the premier Iraqi football league. Its champions go on to represent Iraq in the Asia Club Championship. The Haris Al-Maliki club is considered the powerhouse club in the country. However, all the matches appear to be popular, as they often attract sold out crowds. In addition, many Iraqis follow the results closely in the media with hopes their team can come out on top. Major institutions like the police and army also field teams giving members of such institutions more reasons to support their team. The Iraqi football love keeps the population happy during the league season and allows rival institutions to resolve their tensions on the pitch instead of on the streets. What a beautiful game it is."		
 IRQ.9996.d:0 "Today, King Faisal II of Iraq achieved his majority and has taken his place as ruler of Iraq. Although he ascended the throne at age 4 in 1939 following the death of King Ghazi, his father, the country had been governed by his regent and pro-British uncle Prince ‘Abd al-llah. King Faisal II started the coronation by traveling in an open carriage led by smartly dressed cavalrymen to attend the Iraqi Majlis. He entered the parliament with troops at attention in ceremonial uniforms, all along European lines. After addressing the Majlis, King Faisal II took the oath of kingship and accepted a pledge of loyalty from the Majlis and Iraqi people by the President of the Senate. Following the ceremony the King attended a massive reception where he hosted notable dignitaries, including the Duke of Gloucester. The European style uniforms and practices throughout the coronation indicates King Faisal II hopes to continue the policies of his uncle. Whether he can contain the rising threat of pan-Arabism and Arab nationalism remains uncertain as despite the magnificent ceremony, there were reports of Iraqis from middle class neighborhoods complaining of the coronation`s expenses. In working class districts some Iraqis were put off by an event where the King was surrounded by armed guards and not the people of Iraq."				
 IRQ.9995.d:0 "Ali Jawdad al-Ayoubi has long served the Hashemites in Iraq. After serving for Faisal`s short-lived Syria regime he followed him to Iraq. He took on major leadership positions and diplomatic posts, including several stints as Prime Minister for Iraq. Al-Ayoubi, a seasoned political leader recognizes the changing global order following the end of World War II. In a dramatic diplomatic maneuver, al-Ayoubi flew to Washington D.C. to personally open an Iraqi embassy in the American capital. The Iraqi government recognizes the British are not the paramount power it once was. If the Hashemites are to survive against the rise of anti-monarchal, pan-Arab nationalism and communist agitation it will need to strengthen its ties with the Americans and the new embassy will be the first step in this process. Media in the US reported local excitement and interest to the senior Iraqi leader`s dramatic decision to fly in to personally open an embassy. In Iraq the move is praised as recognizing the global order while anti-monarchists point to this action as Iraq continuing to surrender its sovereignty to colonial forces."	
 IRQ.9980.d:0 "Today, the kingdoms of Iraq and Jordan, have announced to form an Arab Federation, which many see as a response to the United Arab Republic, formed by Egypt and Syria. King Faisal of Iraq and his cousin, King Hussain of Jordan, both descendants of the Hashemite dynasty, that ruled Arabia till 1921, have disclosed that they had long been planning an Arabic union of states. This union, is seen as a direct consequence of Iraq leaving the Baghdad Pact and to ensure the country's independence from their western Arabic counterpart, Egypt.Although a federation by name, many see the new state to be a confederation and has upset a lot of people. The United Arab Republic has yet to make any formal statement on this, though there are reports of Israeli mobilization . Nevertheless, this is a monumental step for the Middle East, and possibly for the world."
 Pachachi.1.d:0 "Seasoned Iraqi politician and Arab nationalist Muzahim al-Pachachi has left Iraq today. The former Iraqi Prime Minister  helped establish one of the earliest Arab nationalist groups in Iraq and played a large role in drafting the 1925 Iraqi constitution. Through the interwar period he served various cabinet positions and diplomatic postings. He successfully established ties with the USSR, militant anti-colonial leaders and other Arab nationalists, putting him at odds with Iraq`s ruling pro-Western Hashemite king. As Prime Minister he pushed Iraq to heavily involve itself in the liberation of Palestine and his continued push for Palestinian rights infuriated Hashemites in both Iraq and Jordan. The Jordanian dynasty has its own vision for Palestine while the Iraqi king fears his pro-Western stance being undercut by anti-Western nationalists. In recent weeks, pro-British Hashemite supporters and palace officials put immense pressure on Muzahim al-Pachachi to leave Iraq in an effort to curb rising Arab nationalist fervor in Iraq. Although they have succeeded in getting him to leave, many feel Muzahim will simply ally with other Arab nationalists in the region and propagate his message unhindered by Hashemite surveillance."			
 CENTO.1.d:0 "The United States has identified the middle east as a vulnerable space through which communism may expand. American efforts to form a Middle East command failed due to anti-colonial sentiments and rising Arab nationalism. Instead the focus has gone to form a “northern tier” and contain communism by linking NATO with SEATO to complete the encirclement of Moscow. This meant forming an alliance that geographically would link Turkey (a NATO member) to Pakistan (a SEATO member). Turkey and Iraq recently signed a treaty of cooperation called the Baghdad Pact which called for joint resistance to outside interference and invited regional states to join in. The United Kingdom, Pakistan, and Iran agreed to join in thus solidifying the Baghdad Pact as a regional alliance of defense, cultural, and economic ties. Although the United States supported this initiative and it fit its regional objectives, it has refused to become a member. This raises questions about how the alliance will cooperate militarily without direct American involvement. Each member state has its own interests and aside from Iran and Turkey, neither Pakistan nor Iraq borders a communist state. On paper the alliance looks strong, but time will tell if in practice it will become a NATO of the Muslim World."				
 kurdish_conflict.1.d:0 "The Kurds have long resisted efforts from the Iraqi state to implement a strong, central government. The Kurds oppose the pro-Arab nationalist school system, lack of protection for their own language and culture. In addition, they oppose efforts by the state to forcibly settle Kurdish communities and change their modes of life. Iraq has traditionally deployed the army to enforce its will on the Kurds but the cycle of armed violence between both groups has proven costly over the years. A new initiative has arrived to help reduce the animosity between the Kurdish population and government. The Iraqi government will reduce military checkpoints and raids. In addition, educational institutions will allow students to speak Kurdish in school, alongside Arabic. Politically, local officials will be given more discretion in dealing with Kurdish tribal groupings, especially with Kurdish chieftains. Giving them more say in government policy will help them buy into the state while not compromising on centralizing state policies. These concessions can help reduce tensions and once things settle down, we can return to bringing the Kurds into the Iraqi state on our terms."	
 IRQ.9997.d:0 "Tawfiq al-Suwaidi has decided to accept King Faisal II`s invitation to form a new government and work with the Hashemites. A brilliant lawyer and former Prime Minister who grew up in the late Ottoman Empire, al-Suwaidi rose to prominence during the British mandate era. Today, he is a seasoned politician and international figure. The Hashemites had hoped his pro-Western leanings would translate to support for their regime but al-Suwaidi has historically proven himself to be a believer in Western principals of representative democracy and individual rights. The Iraqi royal family viewed his previous stints as Prime Minister with suspicion as he allowed political parties to function and directed the interior ministry to relax its operations, particularly against leftists. However, the situation Iraq finds itself in requires strong leadership and a man of al-Suwaidi`s experience and reputation outweighs the risks of his lifting government restrictions and surveillance of dubious groups in the country. For Tawfiq al-Suwaidi he has had a long history of clashing with the Hashemites but he too feels the time maybe right for a more successful relationship and perhaps a more democratic Iraq."
 Abadan_Crisis.1.d:0 "The decision of the Iranian government to nationalize its oil in defiance to its treaties and the rage of Britain has sent shockwaves across Iraq. Iraqis have applauded Iran for securing its sovereignty and defying imperialism while recognizing its own government continues to accept colonial British concessions. Many Iraqis now openly call King Faisal II a British stooge. The Iraqi government is very sensitive to this, as anti-British and anti-colonial sentiments are at an all-time high across the country. Anti-British protesters have appeared in cities across the country and are demanding Iraq assert its own sovereignty. Currently, the Iraqi government receives a fixed royalty on oil sales, which many recognize leaves most of the oil wealth ending in in British hands. The government has two options in how it responds to the Abadan Crisis. It can join Iran and nationalize its own oil industry, rallying the masses and demonstrating the King's position as an Iraqi sovereign. However, doing so would provoke significant British and Western ire, ending Iraq`s decades long cultivation of such ties and leave Iraq exposed internationally as well as domestically. The second option is to negotiate with the British over the current oil concession and perhaps change the model from one of a fixed annual royalty to a profit-sharing scheme where Iraq makes money on each barrel of oil sold. The British may be receptive to this plan as it would not want to risk losing another major concession and it could placate the protesters."
 IRQ.9902.d:0 "King Faisal II grew up hearing of his family`s betrayals by the British and the Saudis. A number of exiles from the Hashimite defeat in 1925 settled in Baghdad and have governed with the Hashimite king. When the Hashimites entered Iraq they had been outsiders and exiles in an alien land but recent events have opened the path for a potential Hashimite return to their ancestral homeland. Saudi Arabia`s brutal regime and arrogance has provoked a pro-Hashimite revolt in the holy land. The Jordanians are expected to involve itself closely with the conflict and considering King Faisal II`s close ties with his relatives in Jordan, Iraq will also be expected to involve itself. Pro-monarchy groups have taken to the streets of Baghdad to demand Iraq support the anti-Saudi freedom fighters, though some of the media speculate these rallies were sponsored by the royal family. Iraq has pledged diplomatic support to the pro-Hashimite forces in Saudi Arabia and are said to be preparing a program to offer arms and volunteers to the rebels. If the civil war in Saudi Arabia turns against the Saudi family, many feel Iraq may elevate its intervention to a direct military intervention. Saudi planners are concerned about the potential of an Iraqi invasion."
 IRQ.9903.d:0 "The King of Jordan has long felt the sting of humiliation at losing the Hijaz. The kingdom`s founder, King Abdullah could do little as the Saudis seized his homeland and caused a stream of Hashimite refugees and supporters to flee to Aman. Since that period, Jordan had evolved from an emirate into a kingdom. It possessed a modern military and the Hashimites enjoyed extensive political power. However, the failure of saving the Hijaz still hurts and many believe it has driven Jordanian desires to secure Jerusalem. Now, news has reached Aman of pro-Hashimite fighters emerging to fight against Saudi rule over the holy land. The anti-Saudi forces have called on the Hashimites and their supporters abroad to offer support. The Jordanian government will not abandon its supporters and orders have been made to offer arms, volunteers, and diplomatic support for the fighters. Descendants of exiles from 1925 have volunteered support and rumors in Aman say Jordanian forces are erecting camps near the Saudi border to support fighters. At the moment, direct military intervention has not occurred but if the Saudi position worsens, many believe the Jordanians may deploy its small but efficient army into the fray."
 IRQ.9994.d:0 "President Gamal Nasser`s newly established United Arab Republic (UAR) threatens the entire Arab world. With Egypt and Syria firmly under his control, emboldened Nasserist sympathizers across the region have taken to the streets demanding change. No doubt the first target will be Jordan, governed by a fellow Hashemite king who faces the prospect of a military conflict and an internal uprising inspired by the UAR. To offset this threat, the seasoned Iraqi leader Nuri al-Said has proposed Iraq start an alliance called the Arab Federation with Jordan. Unlike the UAR, the Arab Federation will not eradicate either nation`s identity but instead work to unify the foreign policy and defense of both states. Both Hashemite rulers in Iraq and Jordan have long sought to unite their kingdoms but these previous efforts all ended in failure. However, with the UAR threat looming, it is clear neither Iraq nor Jordan can survive alone. King Faisal II has dispatched an Iraqi delegation led by Nuri al-Said to propose the Arab Federation to his cousin, the King of Jordan."
 IRQ.9991.d:0 "In Aman today, the Jordanian government received a high level delegation form Iraq led by senior political leader Nuri al-Said. He brought with him a personal message from King Faisal II of Iraq urging his cousin to join an alliance he calls the Arab Federation. Al-Said explained the establishment of the United Arab Republic (UAR) upended the balance of power in the region and the Hashemite states of Iraq and Jordan must unite to survive this threat. The Iraqi delegation explained the alliance sought to mainly unite both nations foreign policy and defense coordination, not threaten the governance and national identity of either state. After the talks, the Iraqi delegation left Aman and the Jordanian government considered their options. The threat of the UAR on its borders was very real as were the number of UAR sympathizers within Jordan, especially among the Palestinian population. Having an alliance of this type with Iraq would restore balance in the region and fulfill a long-term family ambition for the Jordanian monarchy to unite with Iraq without losing Jordanian identity. On the other hand, Iraq may use the alliance to hijack Jordan`s carefully constructed defense and foreign policy. The King weighs his options and after careful consideration he must decide whether to accept the Iraqi proposal for an Arab Federation or reject it."

 OPCASTOR:0 "The airborne operation of Operation Castor has succeeded! In order to create new fortifications in strategic and suppliable areas following Giap's invasion of Laos, paratroopers from the French Foreign Legion airdropped into Dien Bien Phu in Northwestern Vietnam over the past few days in order to establish a fortified “hedgehog” airhead to continue advancement against the Viet Minh. This staging was met with little resistance, and will be highly useful in attacks and defenses in North Vietnam in the coming months. It is the most massive air operation since the World War."
 VIN_HELL:0 "Following the massive air operation of Operation Castor, General Giap sensed that the Foreign Legion held a weak foothold in Dien Bien Phu. The Viet Minh began to move their forces away from the front line and to the small town in Northwest Vietnam. The guerillas began a series of attacks on Foreign Legion patrols in the area, slowly whittling them down. Over 57 days, the troops held against wave after wave of attacks on their positions until they were eventually repelled. Veterans of the almost two month long conflict now refer to it as the 57 Days of Hell."

The attempt, plotted by King Saud, failed as the security chief hired for the job, was infact an ardent Nasser supporter. The plan called for strapping a bomb to Nasser's jet and then detonating it mid flight. The Egyptians have proved the Saudi attempt by presenting the three cheques given to the plotters for the deed. Tensions rose between the United Arab Republic and Saudi Arabia even further and this attempt is thought to be carried out in fear of Egypt's rising power and the newly formed UAR, uniting Egypt and Syria. Nasser has labelled Saud as an enemy of the Arabic people and the Egyptians are already rallying against the Saudis. The House of Saud is soon to hold a meeting on the matter and the King may be stripped of his power over this failure as well as other recent incidents...."
 
 #Qasim Iraq Events
 Qasim.1.d:0 "For years the Anglo-American owned Iraqi Petroleum Company (IPC) exploited Iraqi oil and its profits for its own benefit. The old regime had been too dependent on the West and sought to accommodate IPC interests when negotiating agreements before the revolution. However, following, the new revolutionary regime of Prime Minister Abd al-Karim Qasim decided the era of Iraqi subservience to the IPC must end. Prime Minister Qasim has demanded a large stake in the IPC and that most profits must go to the Iraqi state. The IPC instead refused and in response the Prime Minister directed a massive increase in tariffs to put the pressure on. Today, the government announced the enactment of Law No. 80 to deliver a major blow to the IPC and liberate Iraqi territory from foreign exploitation. The new law seizes 99.5 percent of the land conceded to the IPC over the years by the old regime and halts new oil explorations. No compensation will be given to the IPC and Prime Minister Qasim announced the land would be given to Iraqi farmers as soon as possible. Prime Minister Qasim in one move weakened the IPC, galvanized public support for his regime, and secured land to support the new government`s land reform policies."
 Qasim.2.d:0 "Following the successful revolution and liberation of Iraq from the puppets of imperial powers, the Iraqi Free Officers must begin the process of dismantling the last vestiges of colonialism from Iraq. The corrupt monarchy had long been a stooge for British interests and they kept Iraqis tied to them and their dying empire. Prime Minister Abd al-Karim Qasim announced Iraq would no longer keep the Iraqi dinar pegged with the British pound. Instead the dinar will be pegged to the US dollar, though maintaining its original conversion. Iraq had long had its currency controlled by the British, first with the Indian rupee being introduced after World War I and then the creation of the Iraqi dinar at par with the British pound. By removing the sterling currency Iraq abandons the British financial world and ultimately makes the currency more competitive as the dollar has quickly become the global currency of the twentieth century." 
 Qasim.3.d:0 "Following the Iraqi Revolution, Brigadier Abd al-Karim Qasim, the leader of the Iraqi Free Officers, announced the abolishment of the monarchy and formation of the Republic of Iraq. The revolution has now politically destroyed an institution it physically decimated during the revolution when the Free Officers oversaw the mass execution of senior royal family members and their supporters. As a new constitutional framework develops, it will be along the lines of a republican government. For many Iraqis the monarchy represented imperial control over the country. Throughout Iraq`s history the King constantly sided with the British over the Iraqi people. Within the military this was most acute during the Anglo-Iraq War of 1941 when the Hashemites backed the British invasion of Iraq to crush the pro-Axis government. In the monarchy, the interests of the elites and their backers dominated governance, now as a republic, power would return to the Iraqi people."  
 Qasim.4.d:0 "The Iraqi government under Prime Minister Abd al-Karim Qasim announced the ratification of the Interim Constitution. The new constitution approved in a referendum and presented by the cabinet declares Iraq a republic. Islam will be the official religion and the document calls for Iraq to be ruled by Arabs and Kurds together. Executive authority lies with the three-member Presidency Council and this is overseen by the legislative Ministerial Council. Finally, the judiciary is to remain independent from politics and should preserve Iraqi citizens their rights. Significantly, the constitution affirms Iraq`s status as an Arab League member but calls for Iraqi identity to not be divided by ethnicity as it provides equal status to Arabs and Kurds. More importantly, the constitution places citizens as the source of authority for the whole nation, in stark contrast to the monarchical era where sovereignty rested in the royal family and power was kept among those at the very top. For the Kurds the new government has already announced its intentions to provide amnesty to Kurdish fighters from the uprisings in the 1940s as a sign that Arabs and Kurds will run Iraq as equals. Schools have also been asked to accept Kurdish as an official language for the classroom alongside Arabic. Despite the concentration of power resting with the two councils, Iraqis are optimistic the new constitution and guaranteed individual rights will usher a golden age for Iraqi political and social development."
 CENTO.2.d:0 "News of the Iraqi revolution sent shockwaves across the capitals and military headquarters of Central Treaty Organization (CENTO) members. Iraq had been a founding member and as an Arab state was critical for efforts to advertise the alliance in the region. Arab nationalist propaganda long called CENTO an imperialist project and this pressure hurt the alliance`s ability to attract more members. The Iraqi Free Officers who bloodily overthrew the monarchy are ardent Arab nationalists and they have announced the new government would withdraw from all previous international alliances, including CENTO. As the alliance is headquartered in Baghdad, the new Iraqi government demanded it be evacuated, Turkey has offered to host the alliance in Ankara. The withdrawal of Iraq greatly weakens the alliance but the failure of the Americans or British to protect the Iraqi monarchy from this coup has also led to rumblings about whether the alliance offers any benefits. Several states are said to be considering if the benefits of working in CENTO outweigh the risks of incurring internal unrest or foreign interference. Time will tell if this action marks the beginning of the end for CENTO."    
 Qasim.5.d:0 "The incredibly popular Kurdish leader and fighter Mustafa Barzani and his supporters arrived in Iraq today. The government of Prime Minister Abd al-Karim Qasim invited the Kurdish revolutionary to emphasize the seriousness of his government`s proposals to forge a new Iraqi identity based on a shared Arabic-Kurdish cultural identity. The two leaders met with smiles and many Iraqis were thrilled at the sight of a senior Iraqi military officer and senior Kurdish guerilla fighter together as partners. For Qasim the move makes a lot of sense as he faces increasing pressure from more radical Arab officers in the military who want Iraq to embrace an Arab nationalist vision and unite the country with other Arab nationalists. More importantly, Barzani can help secure the acceptance of the new revolutionary government by the Kurdish people. For Barzani, his arrival and amnesty in Iraq has ended his long exile from Kurdistan and hopes to use Qasim to help him consolidate his political position within Kurdistan. The move highlights Arab-Kurdish unity to Iraq`s citizens but for Qasim it blunts the radical Arab nationalist threat to his power and for Barzani it gives him a powerful ally in Baghdad he can work with as he consolidates power in Kurdistan. Whether this arrangement will last between the two remains to be seen as both men are ambitious and will not react kindly if they suspect betrayal."    
 KuwaitDemands.1.d:0 "The Republic of Iraq has actively withdrawn from its commitments with us and are pushing Iraq into closer ties with the communist world. In the latest sign of Iraq`s increasingly hostile attitude, its leader, Abd al-Karim Qasim announced he planned to incorporate Kuwait into Iraq. Iraq claims Kuwait was historically part of the Ottoman province of Basra and thus an integral part of Iraq. We have reports of a military buildup on the Iraq-Kuwaiti border and have received word Iraq expects a response from us regarding their demand for Kuwait. Intelligence notes Qasim is motivated to make these demands in order to garner support of Arab nationalist officers within a politically divided Iraqi officer class. The Kuwaitis themselves invoked our treaty obligation to defend the country in the face of threats but ultimately it is for us to decide whether to get involved. Choosing to support Kuwait`s freedom from Iraq will help keep its strategic oil resources in friendly hands but cost us the deployment of military assets. It would also force Iraq to either invade or backdown. Though Qasim wants the support of nationalist officers, it is unclear if he will risk a war and his regime to get such support. Consenting to Iraq`s demands will save us from having to commit assets in a foreign theatre but we will probably lose access to Kuwaiti oil fields. For Qasim our acceptance will strengthen his regime but this may prove beneficial as he is not likely to embrace the pan-Arab nationalists totally and can be expected to likely resist pan-Arab unification efforts in the region. We must now decide whether to reject Iraq`s territorial demands and guarantee Kuwait or consent to Iraq`s supposed historical claims to Kuwait."
 KuwaitDemands.2.d:0 "The British government announced it would back Kuwait and rejected Iraqi demands on Kuwait as baseless. The British Prime Minister is said to be consulting with his senior military staff to devise contingency plans for the crisis in Kuwait. This turn of events is no doubt a major blow to our just claims for Kuwait and the spreading of Arab liberation to another people`s oppressed by a decadent monarchy bloated by its imperial masters. Our military officers are divided on how to respond, certainly the hawkish nationalists are telling the leadership we commit to our demands and take Kuwait by force. A rapid war of conquest can secure Kuwait before Britain arrives and once, they see the new status quo they will have to concede to the new reality. Our public proclamations have galvanized this part of the military and the general population as pro-government and pro-War rallies have taken place across the country. However, on the other side the other officer factions point out the disaster of the 1941 Anglo-Iraq War and that we could not expect the British to just back down once hostilities began. They suggest it would be reckless to sacrifice the Iraqi revolution and its tremendous gains just for public support and Kuwait with their backwards population. We must decide on whether to push forward with our demands and secure Kuwait forcibly, risking a major military conflict. Or if we should maintain our claim but reject a military solution and de-escalate the situation but at the cost of public humiliation and hostility from the Arab nationalist regimes in the region" 
 KuwaitDemands.3.d:0 "The British government announced upon reviewing our just claims they agree and will begin the process of handing over Kuwait to Iraqi sovereignty. The Iraqi government thanked the British for their honesty and across Iraq mass rallies in support of the government have occurred. Across the Arab World the Republic of Iraq is now seen as a great revolutionary government committed to liberating all Arabs from decadence and imperialism. The tiny Kuwaiti military forces have stood down as our jubilant forces drove into Kuwait City to begin the handover process. The local British and Kuwaiti military officials stood down and formally handed administration over to our forces. There are news of sporadic rioting and shootings by our forces but our commanders in Kuwait insist they have the situation under control. We will soon be dispatching civil officials and a new military governor to oversee the integration of Kuwait to Iraq. Certainly our government now enjoys massive public support but more importantly, the divisions within our own military have calmed down as all factions now recognize the great leadership demonstrated by our success"   
 MosulUprising.1.d:0 "Prime Minister Abd al-Karim Qasim has increasingly relied on the support of the Iraqi Communist Party to blunt the influence of the Arab nationalist Ba`ath Party. The Arab nationalists, especially from within the military, continue to agitate for Iraq to integrate itself with the United Arab Republic (UAR). These developments saw tensions rise between both factions across Iraq. After hearing about coup plots being hatched by Arab nationalist officers in Mosul, Qasim encouraged communists to march in a show of force. This led to street clashes between the two sides in Mosul and the deployment of local army units against the communists. Amidst the chaotic violence, the commander of the Mosul garrison, the Colonel Abdel Wahab Shawaf decided to attempt a coup against Qasim with support from nationalist officers and the UAR. Shawaf`s forces executed communist leaders, took over the Mosul radio station, kidnapped a British oil technician, and called on sympathetic tribes and military units to join him. The coup attempt quickly failed as military support from other units failed to materialize and Qasim easily organized forces from Baghdad to breakup the rebellion, though Radio Mosul propagated the Ba`ath Pary nationalist agenda. As the plot began failing, Colonel Shawaf was killed by his own men but the violence did not end as government forces arrived in Mosul to retaliate against the rebel troops and nationalists for their actions. Although Prime Minister Qasim did not really face a major challenge to his power, the UAR`s support for the coup, has raised tensions between the two states. The communists were strengthened while the Ba`ath Party`s Arab nationalist agenda gained a major platform. Both consequences ultimately weaken Qasim`s position as he does not wish to become communist nor does he want to embrace the pan-Arab vision espoused by the Ba`ath."

 RamadanRevolution.1.d:0 "The tumultuous reign of Prime Minister Abd al-Karim Qasim came to a bloody end today. After three days of fighting, the Iraqi Ba`ath Party along with allies in the military released pictures of the bullet-ridden body of Qasim to the public. This announcement marks the end of the coup and confirms Colonel Abdul Salam Arif as Iraq`s new leader. Prime Minister Qasim came to power after leading the military in overthrowing the Iraqi Hashemite monarchy. Qasim however, struggled to assert his authority and curtail the influence of multiple factions in the country. He long sought to use the communists as a counter-balance to pan-Arab nationalist fervor in Iraq. Yet his fear of communists meant he often purged the communists as well, leaving his base divided and weak. This political weakness and constant balancing were further hindered by Iraq`s economic challenges and Qasim`s mishandling of foreign affairs, especially with regards to Kuwait. The Iraqi Ba`ath Party recognized these weaknesses and after allying itself with pan-Arab officers, they decided to act. On the first morning of the coup, the communist head of the air force was assassinated and troops moved to secure Baghdad. Qasim and his supporters, including communists, resisted for three days before Qasim surrendered. The assassination and Qasim`s purges meant the communist could not mobilize effectively which ultimately cost Qasim his life. Many analysts suggest the new regime may embrace pan-Arab nationalism and quickly move to achieve these goals. Rumors from Baghdad suggest soldiers are rounding up communist sympathizers across the city, further solidifying Ba`ath influence."
 RamadanRevolution.2.d:0 "Husain al-Radi announced on the radio that the Iraqi Communist Party has defeated the nationalist coup and will now administer the country. This marks the end of a bold coup attempt led by pan-Arab nationalist officers and the Ba`ath Party against the regime of Prime Minister Abd al-Karim Qasim. The Ba`athis had sought to end Qasim and communist sympathizers by beginning the coup with an assassination attempt on the communist chief of the air force, Jalal al-Awqati, this attempt failed. When rebel tanks moved to seize the radio station they were stunned to see Iraqi air force planes come in to stop their advance while communist sympathizers secured the station. In the ensuing violence the pro-Ba`ath military units overpowered the pro-Qasim forces, leading to Qasim`s death in Baghdad. However, the Ba`ath failed to capitalize as they did not control the radio stations and their efforts to secure key sites were hindered by the establishment of communist strongholds across pro-communist neighborhoods in Baghdad. Without clear news regarding a Ba`ath victory, nervous Iraqi troops across the country began returning to their barracks while others joined the communist fighters operating out of their strongholds. The Ba`athist coup soon failed due to a lack of momentum and the communists emerged from their strongholds to declare victory. Ba`ath leadership is said to have gone underground and Husain al-Radi is expected to soon announce the Iraqi Communist Party`s program for economic and social transformation."
 RamadanRevolution.3.d:0 "Prime Minister Abd al-Karim Qasim addressed the media with several detained senior Ba`ath and pan-Arab military officers standing behind him. Just five days earlier the officers and Ba`ath Party supporters launched a vicious coup to end Qasim`s rule and push the country on a more pan-Arab path. Despite initially assassinating the communist air chief and seizing control of the country`s radio station, the plotters ultimately failed to consider Qasim`s popularity among Iraqis. Qasim long sought to play is base of supporters against one another and purge groups like the communists when they appeared too powerful, greatly hindering the ability of his supporters to mobilize support. However, Qasim`s recent success with regards to Kuwait galvanized Iraqis and once the communists spread word of the coup, pro-Qasim forces and the communists saw scores of volunteers show up. The movement of Ba`ath forces and allies were also hindered in multiple pro-Qasim neighborhoods. All this allowed Qasim to rally his supporters and following his counter-attack, the Ba`ath forces virtually disintegrated, securing Qasim`s victory. In his address Qasim thanked the Iraqi people for their aid and declared Iraq`s revolutionary path will not be hindered by those forces who seek to destroy the unity of Iraq."
