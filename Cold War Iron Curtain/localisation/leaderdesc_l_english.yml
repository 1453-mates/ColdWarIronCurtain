During the Second Italo-Ethiopian War and the subsequent occupation of Ethiopia during World War II, Haile Selassie made Ethiopia an active member of the League of Nations while later leading a government in exile in London. Seen as a modernizer by his supporters, Haile Selassie believes Ethiopia needs to open itself to the outside world. Upon coming to power Selassie organized Ethiopia's entry into the League of nations and in 1945 Ethiopia was a founding member of the United Nations. While most of Ethiopia is illiterate and has little opinion of the affairs of its nation, among the intelligencia and student youth there is in contrast a wide array of criticisms towards the Emperor. These critics, view Haile Selassie as an autocrat who has failed to end the immense and devestating poverty brought by the archaic feudalistic system which controls most of the nation's people."
