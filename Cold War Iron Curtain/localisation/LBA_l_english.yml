 LBA.5.d:0 "    His Majesty, King Idris, has called upon Mohieddin Fikini to form a new cabinet for the current goals of the state. The new avenues of change being adopted by Fikini will be the attempt to abolish the federal system and form a unitary government, launch our first five years plan of development, and amend the 1951 constitution. We can only hope this will lead to a more united and safe Libya, given the flames of revolution in Cairo and Baghdad."
 LBA.9.d:0 "    The 1951 Constituion of Libya was originally created upon the integration of Fezzan and Tripolitania by the Cyrenaican Emirate under Emir Idris I, and has since become obsolete to the current wishes of our establishment. Changes in the new constituion drafted by Mohieddin Fikini include the adoption of a unitary state and the right to vote for Women."
 LBA.10.d:0 "   In admiration of the great legacy of Arab Egypt, Idris and the Libyan government have been inviting traveling teachers from neighboring Egypt to help teach our children. However, observers have noticed a focus in Egyptian history in the education and many of the teachers are youth which have openly Pan-Arabist beliefs which glorify Nasser and the Egyptian revolution..."
 LBA.13.d:0 "   King Idris has signed an agreement stating he will step down in favor of his next of kin, however this will not be in effect for a number of months and the government will need to establish a transitional regency. We shall tread carefully, however, as this may be in the interest of more radical factions in our country."
 LBA.11.d:0 "   The infleunce of Pan-Arabism can be seen enfatuating every aspect of Libyan life. Whether it be Radio Cairo, or the Egyptian teacher, buisnessman, or teller, the youth have constant exposure to these radical ideas sweeping accross the Arab world."
 LBA.14.d:0 "   These previous months have been a very decisive factor in changing Libya's political situation. While his Majesty, King Idris, was absent recieving medical attention in Egypt, a small group of the officers assigned to signal companies stormed Bayda and Benghazi. Prince Hasan has renounced all claims to the throne and told the Libyan people to not resist the new government. Whether the RCC can assert their control throughout the country is yet to be seen. A young Bedouin named Muammar al-Qaddafi seems to have taken the lead of these officers and is essentially their de facto leader."
