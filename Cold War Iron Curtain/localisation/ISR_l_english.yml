 Shlomo_Shamir_desc:0 "Shlomo Shamir was born as Shlomo Rabinowitch in Berdychiv, Russian Empire 15th of June 1915. He was taken to Palestine in 1925 and in 1929 he joined the Haganah and was instrumental in smuggling weapons and illegal Jewish immigrants into Palestine during the time of the British Mandate and the White Paper of 1939. In 1940 he received his pilot license, and in the same year he joined the Royal Air Force in order to fight the Nazis and gain experience in warfare. In 1946 he was discharged from the British military with the rank of major. In 1948 he was ordered by Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion to lead the Israeli 7th Armored Brigade in the fight to conquer Latrun. He was also instrumental in creating the Burma Road. At the end of the 1947–1949 Palestine war he was offered to be appointed as the Chief of the General Staff, but he refused. Instead he served other capacities, eventually becoming the Commander of the Israeli Navy."

 israel.5.d:0 "Today the State of Israel has officially been introduced into the United Nations, decided upon in an intense vote that resulted in a 37-12 decision, sealing the fragile thing that is the Jewish nation's independence, for now at least. With Israel showing some degree of support for the UN partition plan, it is anyone's guess if peace will be achieved, but no doubt many believe this to be the first step in a series of many. As the Western World begins to establish ties and show their support for the infant state, Israel's Arab neighbors are enraged, still reeling from their previous failure to eliminate Israel. The revived Jewish state has now left its first modern mark on history."
 israel.6.d:0 "Following months of heated negotiations, the Lausanne Conference, convened by the United Nations, has finally come to an end. The issues of the conference mainly concerned the fallout from the 1948 Arab-Israeli War - including borders, the split of Jerusalem and the 700,000 Palestinian refugees created by the conflict. The demarcation line established after the conflict, seeing Israel control 60% of the original partition plan for a Palestinian state, has been maintained despite further Israeli demands and to the outrage of the Arab States. In addition, the Israelis refused to allow any refugees back to their old homes and rejected the ‘100,000 refugees offer’ proposed by the UN. While tensions remain high and Egypt and Jordan still occupy the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, it appears that the fragile peace in the region has been maintained and Israel’s admission to the United Nations should help lead to a peaceful future for the incredibly volatile region."

 israel.8.d:0 "In a historic event for our nation, the very first local elections have been held throughout the country. The system works so that the residents of cities and local councils vote for a mayor, as well as electing members of the local and city councils, with these votes occurring every legislative election. For the first time since the Arab War, Palestinians have been allowed to vote for their local councillors and so far the whole process has gone smoothly, without any significant reports of political violence. With results continuing to trickle in, the people of Israel are finally able to look back upon the constant conflict of the 40’s, for the first time, from a position of relative peace and security."
 israel.7.d:0 "Ever since our victory in the War of Independence the situation on the Syrian border has been tense, with no official peace treaty ever being signed. The United Nations Israel-Syria Mixed Armistice Commission has been working to observe the terms of the armistice and after many months of negotiations an agreement has finally been made. Under the terms of the Israeli-Syrian General Armistice Agreement, Syrian forces have evacuated occupied territories west of the International Border, which have now become demilitarized zones. Syria still officially maintains control of these areas. However, despite the success of the armistice negotiations, many still doubt the possibility of a lasting peace in the region."

 israelelection.1.d:0 "During 1950, a divide formed between David Ben-Gurion and Mapai and their religious coalition partners, the divide was over education of new immigrants and the inclusion of women in the IDF, David Ben-Gurion wants to give new immigrants secular education and to include women in the IDF while the religious parties fiercely oppose both, the tensions became apparent when Mapai's Education program was shot down in the Knesset, Ben-Gruion took this failure as a Vote of no Confidence in his government, he then announced the dissolution of his government and called for early elections. Despite all these setbacks coupled with growing support for the capitalist and centrist General Zionists and other parties, Mapai still appears to be dominant, but their position may be in danger as the new Immigrants become more and more disillusioned with the Mapai regime and may vote for more fringe parties such as the right wing Herut or the hardline socialist Mapam.

 BEN_GURION_DESC:0 "Long time de-facto leader of the labour Zionist movement and now the first Prime Minister of Israel. Ben-Gurion always had his suspicions for both the far-left and far-right, refusing to include the fellow socialist Mapam in his coalition and utterly refusing to listen to any of the nationalist Herut's demands. He also believes that Israel should retaliate to inflitrations and attacks from Arab countries and will do anything for Israel to be a force to be reckoned with. For now he remains unchallenged, but sooner or later, he could be replaced by the ever more influential younger generations who seek to replace the older generation of the Second Aliyah who held dominance over politics of the Zionist movement and now the Jewish State."
 Sharett_desc:0 "Moshe Sharett is a very different figure than David Ben-Gurion, he is a dove in a party filled with hawks and prefers to use diplomacy to achieve his goals rather than take up arms. When Israel was established, he was appointed as Foreign Minister, he served in that post dilligently, scheduling meetings between David Ben-Gurion and Arab leaders. Sharett opposes aggression or 'adventurism' and believes that Israel needs to be satisfied with the 1949 borders in order for peace to exist in this turmultous region. Even while being a minority in Mapai, he was given the nomination by the party and now serves as Prime Minister of Israel."
 Lavon_desc:0 "Former Defense Minister and an influental member of Mapai, Pinhas Lavon has finally reached the top after an internal power struggle within Mapai. Known as a cunning yet devious figure, Lavon pulls the strings from behind to achieve his goals. Lavon now serves as Prime Minister after giving Mapai an electoral comeback that inserted them back at the top."
 Eshkol_desc:0 "Former Minister of Finance and a compromiser within Mapai, Levi Eshkol has ascended to the top after Mapai's electoral misfortunes. With his compromising nature and the failures of the previous government, Eshkol was elected Prime Minister and has returned Mapai to power."
 Golda_desc:0 "Former Minister of Labour and now Prime Minister, Golda Meir's tough nature has returned her and Mapai to power after a series of defeats. Golda Meir's more direct approach at problem solving reminds many of David Ben-Gurion, how will the 'Iron Lady' of Israel fare in the ever turmultous Middle East?"
 Begin_young_desc:0 "Former leader of the Irgun and leader of the nationalist Herut, Menachem Begin was swept to office by a populist wave and now is free to enact his mentor, Ze'ev Jabotinsky's vision for Israel as well as his own vision. Begin's victory signals a dramatic upset in Israeli politics as the socialist Mapai's dominance of the Israeli political sphere was disturbed for the first time ever."
 Yaari_desc:0 "Leader of Mapam and a socialist activist, Meir Ya'ari has ascended to power following a populist wave that swept his rival, Mapai out of power. Ya'ari follows a more 'pure' vision of Socialism and views the Soviet Bloc in a more positive light even though he refrains from allying with it."
 Rokach_desc:0 "Former Mayor of Tel Aviv and leader of the General Zionists, Israel Rokach has emerged victorious with the public becoming disillusioned with Mapai's austerity policies and have finally 'screamed' with them electing him and his capitalist General Zionists. Finally in power, he is free to enact capitalist policies that will remodel Israel's economy to more strongly resemble those of the West and perhaps will usher a new era for the Zionist movement with Liberalism dominating instead of Socialism."
 israel.9.d:0 "In a remarkable discovery over recent years, scrolls containing ancient Jewish manuscripts have been found in the Qumran Caves. These caves are near the Dead Sea, a Salt Lake located in the hotly contested region of the West Bank. While the scrolls themselves were discovered in 1947, it’s only in more recent years that teams have made efforts to excavate them. As the historical significance of them has become more and more apparent, their value has increased and the search progress has subsequently accelerated rapidly. After five years of excavations, the last scrolls have finally been recovered from the cave. In total there are 972 manuscripts with 7 scrolls, found in a total of 11 caves. The recovery of these ancient scrolls represents a considerable step forward for the study of both the Jewish faith and the Hebrew Language, as the rush to understand the contents of the scrolls has began."
 israel.10.d:0 "After lifting the British restriction on Jewish immigration and securing our independence, the number of Jews moving to Israel from all around the world skyrocketed, with more Iraqi, Iranian, Moroccan and Yemenite Jews moving in ever increasing numbers. While the state will have to adjust to taking care of such a rapidly increasing population, the immigrants are full of joy and hope upon reaching their new home where they shall finally live free."
 israel.11.d:0 "Ever since the establishment of the country, there was a great debate on what the school curriculum should look like. Mapai and other secular parties want children to have a general education similar to that in the West, while HaPoel HaMizrachi, Mizrachi and other Ultra-Orthodox parties want to introduce religious education to 'revive the Jewish spirit of the nation'. This debate doesn't seem close to ending since Prime Minister Ben-Gurion has to appease both sides in order to keep his increasingly unstable coalition together."
 israel.12.d:0 "The Palmach, which fought valiantly alongside the IDF in the war of Indepdence, has been dissolved and integrated into the mainstream IDF, Ben-Gurion stated that he wants to 'de-politicze' the Palmach, as he sees it as too closely tied to Mapam, which he holds animosity and suspicion towards."
 israel.13.d:0 "Immigration camps, many of which were recently turned into Transition Camps or Ma'abarot in the wake of increasing influx of Jewish Immigrants, are constantly popping up across Israel, while the government did reserve as many apartments and houses they could, even those were not enough to hold the tens of thousands of Jews that arrive each month. Many new immigrants now live in the Ma'abarot, where conditions are harsh, according to a journalist visiting a Ma'abara 'there were two faucets for everyone, About a thousand people. The toilets had no roof and were infested with flies.'"
 israel.14.d:0 "Moshe Dayan has started an initiative to move Bedouins away from the Northern Negev and expell them to the Hebron Hills. This move soon gained controversy after it attracted the attention of Moshe Sharett and the Foreign Ministry who called the initiative 'Stupid'"
 israel.15.d:0 "Facing budget cuts due to the ongoing economic crisis, IDF Chief of Staff Yigal Yadin has offered his resignation today, the Prime Minister quickly appointed Mordechai Maklef as his replacement."
 israel.16.d:0 "David Ben-Gurion has appointed Pinchas Lavon, a senior Mapai member to act as Defense Minister after the former served at that post since 1948, many speculate that Prime Minister Ben-Gurion is planning to retire from politics."
 israel.17.d:0 "Mordechai Maklef, who was appointed as Yigal Yadin's replacement following the latter's resignation, has offered his own resignation, after being unable to cooperate with Minister of Defence Pinchas Lavon. the Prime Minister has swiftly appointed the relatively young Moshe Dayan as the new Chief of Staff."
 israel.18.d:0 "Facing electoral defeat, Mapai was sent into a frenzy as Ben-Gurion's leadership position seemed more vulnerable than ever, Levi Eshkol, a 'centrist' in his party and the compromiser figure, was approached by anti Ben-Gurionist figures asking him for his opinion on them ousting Ben-Gurion. The destiny of Mapai depends on Eshkol's decision, Eshkol decides to..."
 israel.19.d:0 "With the aid of Eshkol, David Ben-Gurion has secured his position and prevented a takeover of the party, he now gives party leadership positions to loyalists such as the young Moshe Dayan and Shimon Peres."

After a short time of deliberation the nominee will be..."
 israel.21.d:0 "With the aid of Levi Eshkol, who saw an opportunity to strengthen his position in the party, anti Ben-Gurionists have taken over the Mapai leadership and de-facto ousted Ben-Gurion from the party, they have offered the leadership to Levi Eshkol, who they hoped could bridge the gap between Mapai elders and younger Mapainiks. Levi Eshkol isn't excited to become party leader just yet and suggested the new leadership to name Golda Meir their nominee in case he turns the nomination down. After a short time of deliberation, Eshkol decides to..."
 israel.22.d:0 "The Fedayeen, a Palesitnian nationalist militia, has started a wave of terrorist attacks on Israeli targets and civilians, the IDF and the government will now have to cope with that reality."
 israel.23.d:0 "The Fedayeen have attacked a military convoy today, with several wounded, this corresponds with a current wave of attacks perpetuated by the Fedayeen militias, some advisers call for 'reprisal operations' in Fedayeen territory to disarm or at least weaken them for a while, other commanders advise to 'wait and see' what happens."
 israel.24.d:0 "IDF forces have entered Gaza a couple of days ago and are now reporting that they have found and destroyed Fedayeen bases there, this operation severely weakens the Fedayeen as one of its main bases is now destroyed."
 israel.25.d:0 "The IDF reports that they have found and destroyed the last Fedayeen bases in the West Bank effectively incapacitating the militia, experts say that the Fedayeen won't be a threat to Israeli security any longer after this operation."
 israel.26.d:0 "The Kastner Trial has ended today, when the trial started it seemed like it was going to be about the defendant, Malchiel Gruenwald accusation of Mapai member Rudolf Kastner's alleged cooperation with the Nazis during the Holocaust, Gruenwald's lawyer, Shmuel Tamir, has managed to flip the case and made it about Mapai's role in the Holocaust and how much it tried to help Jews escape from the Nazis. After much deliberation, the judge ruled in Gruenwald's favour, accusing Kastner of having 'sold his soul to the devil.". Kastner's membership in Mapai coupled with the findings of the court made Herut submit a motion of no-confidence in the Knesset, this motion failed to pass, but the damage has been done to Mapai."
 israel.27.d:0 "In preparation for the elections in July, leaders of the HaPoel HaMizrachi, Mizrachi, Agudat Yisrael and Poalei Agudat Yisrael have met to discuss the future of their alliance, most say that the alliance is shaky at best and should be dissolved, but some voices say that a united front helps promote their shared interests most effectively, after hours of deliberation, the leadership announces that..."
 israel.28.d:0 "Herut and the United Religious Front have always had a disdain for Mapai, even though the latter showed it more overtly. Today, the leader of Herut, Menachem Begin has sent a letter to Chaim-Moshe Shapira proposing an electoral alliance between Herut and the URF citing that if he is to accept, that Herut will move to promote 'Jewish values' and 'Religious purity', he also said that any alliance against Mapai is a good step towards ending the 'socialist regime'. While some may disagree, this is indeed a good offer on Begin's part, after a short time thinking about the proposal, Shapira has sent a reply to Begin confirming his support for the alliance."
 israel.30.d:0 "Our recent decision to start the purchase of weapons from the United States has angered Mapam, who is decidedly pro-USSR, it angered them so much that they introduced a motion of no confidence, luckily this motion didn't pass and it just shows that Mapam stands alone against our plans."
 israel.49.d:0 "A week ago, The Knesset decided to ban Shabbat public transportation, what following was a few radio operators talking about it badly, and how it caused them problems going to their own workplace. But last Sunday, during an interview with Ben Gurion in the radio station Kol Yisrael, he publicly stated "The ban on Shabbat Transportation was a mistake that was up to the voters' hand and mind, their empathy towards URF has gone exceedingly wrong, and the elections have proven that." The Government has not responded yet, but seems to have not ignored it. In Beit HaKnesset, in Jerusalem, a small demonstration have gathered up against it in a Wednesday morning, Ben Gurion was not on scene, but a Heirut MK Uri Zvi Greenberg was seen entering the Knesset and was shouted on by the demonstrators."
 israel.50.d:0 "Following the victory of the Herut-URF alliance, Prime Minister Begin has announced his plan for the economy: a 'mixed' economy mixing socialism and capitalism while following Jabotinsky's '5 Mems'."
 israel.51.d:0 "A government proclamation today has declared Judea and Samaria or the West Bank as an integral part of Israel. This decision raised tensions with Jordan who see this claim as jingoistic and imperialistic. Prime Minister Begin has proclaimed that "Judea and Samaria are a core and indivisible part of the land of Israel and hence the State of Israel.""
 israel.52.d:0 "Revisionist Youth movement Beitar have endorsed the government's policies as following the "spirit of Jabotinsky" and that they will lead to a "better Israel"."
 israel.53.d:0 "The United Religious Front is experiencing increasingly damaging divides and internal conflicts between two factions. The "old guard" who rallied under URF leader Haim Moshe-Shapira and the more national minded "young guard" led by Yosef Burg. The old guard sees the Herut alliance as not benefiting them enough and wish to leave the alliance but stay in the government while the young guard wish to continue or even solidify the alliance with Herut to create a big-tent right wing front in Israeli politics."
 israel.54.d:0 "URF leader Haim Moshe-Shapira has announced today that the Herut-URF alliance will be dissolved effective this evening. Prime Minister Begin has replied saying that the dissolution is a "setback" but calls for further cooperation between Herut and the URF as independent parties."
 israel.55.d:0 "Socialist youth have gone to Jerusalem to protest controversial laws introduced by the government such as the ban on Public Transport in Shabbat. They have called the government to resign but were met with deaf ears. Israeli-Arabs have joined them to protest government previleging its Jewish citizens over its non-Jewish ones. While the protest was large, Herut still remains rather popular with Mapai and other socialist parties struggling to regain their past strength."
 israel.56.d:0 "Prime Minister Begin has decided to call an election in 1955 with Herut still remaining the most popular party. Mapai is planning on a rebound and branding itself as the party for seculars against the "religious fundamentalists" of the Herut-URF alliance while the General Zionists have decided to take a more calm and moderate approach."
 israelOlim.1.d:0 "Many Olim object having to endure the conditions in Ayarot Pituach that we built for them, after an inspection those conditions turned out to be quite bad. While helping the new Olim in improving their conditions should be the obvious thing to do, we are also very short on resources and will need every last resource that we have on hand."
 israelOlim.2.d:0 "A number of Moroccan Jews have filed a complaint to the government citing how they were sprayed with gases and humiliated upon arriving to Israel, this matches a pattern of disdain with our methods of 'integrating' the new Olim from the Middle East and North Africa, should we launch a probe and satisfy them or dismiss the complaint and use our resources on something else?"
 israelOlim.3.d:0 "A number of Olim are facing challenges while trying to integrate into Israeli society, many Olim, especially from the Middle East are traditional in nature while a large part of Israeli society is secular and 'atheist' in nature, so challeges are bound to happen, what we can do is to start a government program to aid the Olim at the expense of resources."
 israelOlim.4.d:0 "Due to growing resentment with government policy, the new Olim are looking for an alternative to Mapai, there are currently two parties that represent that alternative, the right wing Herut, which criticizes Mapai day and night, and the hardline socialist Mapam, which works to end racial discrimination in the country."
 israelOlim.5.d:0 "A number of Olim arriving to Israel have voiced their concern to the government, they're concerned about not having anywhere affordable to live. Many urged the government to build 'development towns' or 'Ayarot Pituach' to house the Olim until the situation normalizes."
 israelpresidents.1.d:0 "Despite his poor health, Chaim Weizmann has decided to stand for re-election as President of Israel, even though no other candidates stood against him, a vote was held anyway and Weizmann has been elected with an absolute majority of votes in the Knesset and will continue to serve as President."
 israelpresidents.2.d:0 "Chaim Weizmann, the first President of Israel has just passed away at the age of 77 in Rehovot, he was buried alongisde his wife at the Weizmann estate. the academic verdict on his grave says that he was a 'patriot long before Israel even existed'."
 israelpresidents.3.d_1:0 "Since President Weizmann died in office, an early Presidential election has been held to elect his successor, the candidates are Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, Ben-Gurion's friend and the Mapai candidate for President and Mordechai Nurock, a Latvian Jew exiled by the USSR after serving in the Latvian Parliament and the Mizrachi party candidate."
 israelpresidents.3.d_2:0 "Since President Weizmann died in office, an early Presidential election has been held to elect his successor, Since Albert Einstein accepted the government's offer to serve as the President, no party sent a candidate to challenge him, securing his election with no opposition."
 israelpresidents.4.d:0 "The famed scientist Albert Einstein is considered to be the greatest Jew alive, and since the President Chaim Weizmann died, Ben-Gurion proposed the idea of inviting Einstein to serve as the the new President. The Ambassador to the United States Abba Ebban has presented this offer to Albert Einstein, saying that the office will not interfere with his scientific studies and he would be free to pursue his hobbies. After thinking for a short time, Einstein presented his response."
 lavonmania.1.d:0 "David Ben-Gurion, leader of Mapai and Prime Minister of Israel, has decided to retire today, he says that the retirement was for personal non-political reasons. His sudden decision to retire and live in the small Kibbutz in the Negev of Sde Boker has launched Mapai into a scramble to find his replacement. Eventually, Moshe Sharett, Minister of Foreign Affairs has emerged as the party's choice to be Ben-Gurion's replacement and will now fill his place as Prime Minister."
 lavonmania.2.d:0 "Following the agreement between our ally Britain and Egypt, who is hostile to us, to withdraw British forces from the Suez Canal by 1956, the IDF High Command was left nervous watching on. The Suez Canal is an important trading point for Israeli ships, and if Britain withdraws from the canal, Egypt could block Israeli ships from entering the canal. Followling that assesment, some men in the IDF High Command proposed the idea of initiating a false flag operation to bomb British owned businesses near the Canal, in order to give an air of instability and convince the British to withdraw from the treaty and remain in the canal. This idea was largely rejected by most of the IDF High Command who proposed that Israel should try and remain diplomatic without taking any reckless measures."
 OperationKadesh.1.d_1:0 "Today Prime Minister [Root.GetLeader], Director General of the Ministry of Defense Shimon Peres and Chief of Staff Moshe Dayan have secretly met the French Minister of Defence, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Chief of Staff in addition to the British Foreign Secretary and his assistant in an isolated house in the French town of Sèvres. They talked about the urgency of the situation in Egypt and their reaction to Egyptian nationalization of the Suez Canal. They then planned a 2 stage invasion of Egypt including a cover story to tell the world. The Israeli side feared to be abandoned by France and Britain in the middle of the invasion and thus demanded that all sides sign a document pleading their allegiance to each other. All leaders left the building with copies of the agreement, now all we have to do is to prepare for an invasion of the Sinai peninsula while the Western powers focus on Egypt."

 israel.9999.d:0 "Israel emerges from the Israeli-Arab War victorious having survived the assault of several armies of Arab nations, Israel now has to deal with the aftermath of the Israeli-Arab War and deal with many of its effects, mostly its effects on the economy. Israel also needs to find its place in the world as the dominance of the socialist Mapai party may as well end and a new era in the history of Zionism could begin. Israel is at the crossroads, a nation whose demographics are altering radically with new immigrants coming from the world over, a nation who just fought a war for its survival and a nation with less than stable politics, how will Israel pave its way to glory, greatness and prosperity in this new strange world?"
 israelOlim.99.d_1:0 "With Government programs swiftly helping Olim integrate into society, many Olim express their thanks to the government that provided them with a new start for their lives. They say that Israel truly is the safehaven of Jews all around the world."
 israelOlim.99.d_2:0 "With limited government aid, many Olim have expressed their disappointment with governemnt policy. While the situation could heal with time, the Olim still face struggles integrating into society."
 israelOlim.99.d_3:0 "With virtually no government aid, many Olim have expressed their anger with the government, tensions are rising in cities with significant Olim populations and resentment to the government has been put firmly in place. While wounds could heal, the general concensus is that that most Olim resent the Mapai regime and will probably continue to resent it for the years to come."
 israel.9998.d:0 "For the last 20 or so years, Mapai has dominated pre-state politics, and their dominance seems to continue even after independence. Several parties have arose to challenge the Mapai dominance: the centrist capitalist General Zionists, hardline socialist, pro-USSR party Mapam, the nationalistic Herut and religious parties. Ben-Gurion now leads a broad "nation building" coalition following his electoral victory in 1949 which includes the General Zionists, United Religious Front and Progressives. Mapai also believes in "Mamlachtiut" which supports giving the state the authority to 'build up the nation' rather than giving it to socialist organizations and trade unions such as the Histadrut. Israel is at a clash of ideologies, a clash of ideas on how to navigate the young state into the future, the choice is yours."
 maki.1.d:0 "Not so long ago, a member of Mapam, Michael Oren was arrested, trialed and imprisoned by the Czechoslovak government in a blatant show trial. Naturally this generated an uproar as Oren became the 'Prisoner of Prague' but the real trouble is happening within Mapam and the government. Prime Minister Ya'ari, Minister of Labour Shmuel Mikunis and other socialists distraught by the trials are considering condemning the Soviet Union and distance themselves from Communism, while Minister of Transport Moshe Sneh and a small cadre of 'loyalists' defend the actions of the USSR and urge the party to keep their pro-USSR policy. After hours of debating and bickering...."
 maki.2.d:0 "Prime Minister Ya'ari has announced a merger with the Communist Maki today, while this was to be expected, some feathers were ruffled, especially Mapai's who were quick to announce that this is a "Soviet Takeover"."
 maki.3.d:0 "Chairman Sneh has announced today that the 'Zionist Movement has ended' and that a new era will begin, a 'socialist era', he proclaimed the formation of the 'Socialist Commonwealth of Israel' or 'Socialist Commonwealth of Palestine' for its Arab citizens. The Commonwealth will be a binational, socialist and atheist state governed by Maki and Chairman Sneh."
 maki.4.d:0 "While we have secured our victory in the last election, one question was never settled, who will be the new leader of the party and thus Prime Minister? the moderate Shmuel Mikunis pushes for a neutral communist regime, not aligned with the USSR while Moshe Sneh pushes for Israel to be an ally of the USSR. Due to the talks going nowhere, many push Meir Vilner as a compromise candidate who will appease everyone, after days and nights of bickering and mudslinging, who will emerge as the new leader of the Maki-Mapam Alliance?"
 maki.5.d:0 "With Maki seeing Mapam compromise more and more towards their viewpoints, Makists are seeing an opening that they can use to have more leverage and perhaps even dominance of the Mapam-Maki Alliance, they plan to exploit the opening by appleaing for the USSR to pressure Mapam into compromising into more of their positions."
 maki.6.d:0 "The USSR has replied today stating that they are ready to apply pressure on Mapam, now we need to wait and see what will happen."
 maki.7.d:0 "The USSR has rejected our request and stated that we aren't in the position to 'start the revolution', we will need to continue under Mapam's leadership."
 maki.8.d:0 "Prime Minister Ya'ari has announced his resignation with his position in the government being less and less secure by the moment. Even though he refrained from stating why he's resigning, many speculate that outside or rather inside forces are behind his resignation. His resignation triggers an early election for this year, where he will lead an interim government until election day."
 israelwar.1.d:0 "Yet again we have found ourselves at war. The Prime Minister has worked to create a temporary wartime national unity government to coordinate the country for the duration of the war."
 israelwar.2.d:0 "It seems that the war has ended, and thus our wartime government has been dissolved. Once again we will return to normal political life.
 german_reparations.1.d:0 "The Federal Republic of Germany, more commonly known as West Germany have come with a proposal to us. Pay reparations for the losses of the Holocaust. While some in Mapai circles support the idea, the majority opposes it. While it is economically valuable, many see it as dismissing the losses of the holocaust and equating it to pieces of paper."
 german_reparations.2.d:0 "Menachem Begin's Herut has voiced outrage with the acceptance of the German Reparation agreement. He said that we are selling the blood of the victims of the Holocaust. His words echo through as more and more people voice their opposition to the agreement."
 german_reparations.3.d:0 "While the government hoped that the controversy surrounding the German Reparations Agreement would ease over and eventually fade away, it was anything but. Today, thousands of protesters gathered near the Knesset in a rally never seen before in our history. The protesters demand that we reject the West German Reparations plan and that we can't forgive the German for the Holocaust so easily."
 german_reparations.4.d:0 "Dov Shilansky has been arrested today while attempting to bring a suitcase bomb into the Foreign Ministry. He was accused of being a member of an underground organization opposed to the German Reparations Agreement and was senteced to 2 years in prison."
 german_reparations.5.d:0 "Despite our rejection of the Reparations from Germany, many in David Ben-Gurion's clique are voicing support of the reparations citing that Israel needs to kickstart the economy somehow and that the reparations are a perfect way to do that."
 german_reparations.6.d:0 "Ben-Gurion has spoken today to a group of supporters saying that Israel needs to act like an "independent people" and not be "slaved away in the past" and that Israel needs the German Reparations to end its economic misery. While most of the public still opposes the agreement, Ben-Gurion's support of the agreement is unwavering."
 german_reparations.7.d:0 "Today Foreign Minister Moshe Sharett has signed the Reparation Agreements from Germany. Despite meeting monumental opposition from the public, the agreement has survived and now German Reparation money can aid Israel's economy."
 german_reparations.8.d:0 "The debate regarding German Reparations has ended, and the 'No' side seems to have won. The Government has announced that no reparations will happen. While the government tries to maintain good relations with West Germany, it acknowledged the public outcry and rejected the German proposal."
 israelelectionnews.1.d:0 "In it's second election since it's founding, the Israeli Workers Party of the Land of Israel, Mapai, celebrated the re-election of David Ben-Gurion to Parliament. Following a 37% in polls, the new government under the second Ben-Gurion cabinet was formed with the support of Mizrachi, Hapoel HaMizrachi, Agudat Yisrael and Poalei Agudat Yisrael  as well as the Democratic List for Israeli Arabs, Progress and Work and Agriculture and Development. Known to the world as the Founding Father of Israel, Ben-Gurion, along with Mapai is celebrated for introducing nation wide Housing and Education reforms in an effort to give the Jewish people a home in the wake of the Holocaust. Now, with Mapai's power seemingly solidified once again, it appears that Ben-Gurion's plans for further development in Israel, including the construction of the National Water Carrier Aqueduct, as well as further settlement of Jews in the Negev,  are all but assured."
 israelelectionnews.2.d:0 "The polls in the Holy Land received an upset today as the Israeli centrist party, known as the General Zionists Party, emerged victorious in this year's general election, with the new Prime Minister Israel Rokach, promising sweeping modernization and reforms across the nation bearing his name. Having served as the Mayor of Tel Aviv since 1936, his tenure has been marked with controversy over his party's past lukewarm relations with the British, a fact that nationalists brought up over and over again. nonetheless, Rokach proved an capable statesmen over the decades, expanding and nearly tripling the population of Tel Aviv during his time in office, eventually merging it with Rokach's birthplace, the Port City of Jaffa, despite Rokach's initial objections to the motions. Considered by some to be the "Westerner" sect of the Israeli political landscape, the General Zionists Party is defined largely by European style liberalism, with an emphasis on the middle class and capitalism as their framework, and while many in the Israeli community might find their purposed policies uncomfortably reminiscent of British policies, the unpopular reaction to Ben-Gurion's strict Austerity measures in previous years made a General Zionist victory all but a foregone conclusion, with the primary campaign focus set on uprooting Mapai in favor of widespread economic reform."
 israelelectionnews.3.d:0 "Pro-USSR socialist party Mapam has defeated the ruling moderate socialist Mapai party in this year's Israeli election. Making their leader, Meir Ya'ari Prime Minister. Many incoming immigrants chose to vote for Mapam due to growing frustration with Mapai's integration policies but not willing to vote for non-socialist parties benefiting Mapam who won the vast majority of their votes."
 israelelectionnews.4.d:0 "Former leader of the paramilitary organization Irgun, Menachem Begin has led his right wing nationalist Herut party to victory in this year's Israeli election, many experts believe that he benefited from votes by the new immigrants who were frustrated with the policies of the ruling Mapai party making Begin and Herut receive a huge increase in votes and allowing them to win the election."

 Yigael_Yadin_desc:0 "Yigael Yadin has enlisted to the Haganah in 1933 at age 15 and has rapidly rose through the ranks since, but after getting into a dispute with the Haganah commander at the time Yitzhak Sade, has left the Haganah to study at a university. Yadin was recalled by Ben-Gurion to serve in the Haganah and later IDF in the War for Independence. At just age 32, Yadin has assumed full control of the IDF Chief of Staff role after former Chief of Staff Ya'akov Dori became unable to fill his role due to an illness. Yadin has made most of the important decisions for the IDF during the War of Independence, including the Ceasefire with Egypt that ended the war."

Dayan has lost his left eye during World War 2 while fighting on the side of the British and has wore a defining eyepatch ever since. Dayan is a member of Mapai and a close friend of David Ben-Gurion and has great political ambitions beyond military service."
 Yitzhak_Rabin_1_desc:0 "Born in 1922 and raised in Tel Aviv, Rabin has enrolled at the Kadoorie Agricultural High School, Rabin excelled in Agriculture related subjects but disliked learning English or the language of the "enemy" as he called it. Rabin joined the Haganah and received basic military training there. He later joined the Palmach section of the Haganah and later became a Commander.

After the war, Allon helped form Mapam but was warned by Ben-Gurion to move himself away from the party as it was a rival to his own Mapai. Allon now is the Commander of Southern Command."
 israel.57.d:0 "The Fedayeen and their Egyptian sponsors have attacked us for long enough, we have decided to act. Today, paratroops of the 890th battalion have landed in Khan Yunis to attack the Egyptian old Tegart Fort and another Egyptian emplacement codenamed Position 132 which dominates the near road which was vital to secure troop withdrawal. Later a Mechanized force led by commander Mordechai "Motte" Gur surrounded the fort while Rafael "Raful" Eitan's forces secured Position 132. All positions were secured by 22:45 hours, explosive charges were set to reduce the tegart fort to rubble. 72 Egyptians were killed and only 1 Israeli got killed, an undeniable success."
 israel.58.d:0 "Egyptian forces have decided to blockade the Gulf of Eilat, so we have decided to surprise attack them on a rather undefended sector. At 20:00 hours the 890th Paratroop Brigade and the Nahal Brigade have attacked Egyptian emplacements in Ras-Siram with Mortar and Artillery support. By morning all Egyptian emplacements were destroyed and 81 Egyptians lay dead and 55 captured while we lost only 5 lives, a stunning victory and a great embarassment for [EGY.GetLeader]."
