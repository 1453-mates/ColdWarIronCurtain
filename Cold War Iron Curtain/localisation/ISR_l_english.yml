 israel.5.d:0 "Today the State of Israel has officially been introduced into the United Nations, decided upon in an intense vote that resulted in a 37-12 decision, sealing the fragile thing that is the Jewish nation's independence, for now at least. With Israel showing some degree of support for the UN partition plan, it is anyone's guess if peace will be achieved, but no doubt many believe this to be the first step in a series of many. As the Western World begins to establish ties and show their support for the infant state, Israel's Arab neighbors are enraged, still reeling from their previous failure to eliminate Israel. The revived Jewish state has now left its first modern mark on history."
 israel.6.d:0 "Following months of heated negotiations, the Lausanne Conference, convened by the United Nations, has finally come to an end. The issues of the conference mainly concerned the fallout from the 1948 Arab-Israeli War - including borders, the split of Jerusalem and the 700,000 Palestinian refugees created by the conflict. The demarcation line established after the conflict, seeing Israel control 60% of the original partition plan for a Palestinian state, has been maintained despite further Israeli demands and to the outrage of the Arab States. In addition, the Israelis refused to allow any refugees back to their old homes and rejected the ‘100,000 refugees offer’ proposed by the UN. While tensions remain high and Egypt and Jordan still occupy the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, it appears that the fragile peace in the region has been maintained and Israel’s admission to the United Nations should help lead to a peaceful future for the incredibly volatile region."

 israel.8.d:0 "In a historic event for our nation, the very first local elections have been held throughout the country. The system works so that the residents of cities and local councils vote for a mayor, as well as electing members of the local and city councils, with these votes occurring every legislative election. For the first time since the Arab War, Palestinians have been allowed to vote for their local councillors and so far the whole process has gone smoothly, without any significant reports of political violence. With results continuing to trickle in, the people of Israel are finally able to look back upon the constant conflict of the 40’s, for the first time, from a position of relative peace and security."
 israel.7.d:0 "Ever since our victory in the War of Independence the situation on the Syrian border has been tense, with no official peace treaty ever being signed. The United Nations Israel-Syria Mixed Armistice Commission has been working to observe the terms of the armistice and after many months of negotiations an agreement has finally been made. Under the terms of the Israeli-Syrian General Armistice Agreement, Syrian forces have evacuated occupied territories west of the International Border, which have now become demilitarized zones. Syria still officially maintains control of these areas. However, despite the success of the armistice negotiations, many still doubt the possibility of a lasting peace in the region."

 israelelection.1.d:0 "During 1950, a divide formed between David Ben-Gurion and Mapai and their religious coalition partners, the divide was over education of new immigrants and the inclusion of women in the IDF, David Ben-Gurion wants to give new immigrants secular education and to include women in the IDF while the religious parties fiercely oppose both, the tensions became apparent when Mapai's Education program was shot down in the Knesset, Ben-Gruion took this failure as a Vote of no Confidence in his government, he then announced the dissolution of his government and called for early elections. Despite all of these setbacks, Mapai still appears to be as dominant as ever, but their position is still precarious with the moderate General Zionists rising in the polls, and with the hardline socialist Mapam, the religious HaPoel HaMizrachi and the fringe nationalist Herut all campaigning intensely against them. who shall emerge victorious?

Can Mapai stay in their dominant position? or will the government's incompetence regarding the captured spies weaken their position and perhaps, allow another party to take the leadership?

 BEN_GURION_DESC:0 "David Ben-Gurion, the long time de-facto leader of the labour Zionist movement and now the first Prime Minister of Israel. Ben-Gurion always had his suspicions for both the far-left and far-right, refusing to include the fellow socialist Mapam in his coalition and utterly refusing to listen to any of the nationalist Herut's demands. He also believes that Israel should retaliate to inflitrations and attacks from Arab countries and will do anything for Israel to be a force to be reckoned with. For now he remains unchallenged, but sooner or later, he could be replaced by the ever more influential younger generations who seek to replace the older generation of the Second Aliyah who held dominance over politics of the Zionist movement and now the Jewish State."
 Sharett_desc:0 "Moshe Sharett is a very different figure than David Ben-Gurion, he is a dove in a party filled with hawks and prefers to use diplomacy to achieve his goals rather than take up arms. When Israel was established, he was appointed as Foreign Minister, he served in that post dilligently, scheduling meetings between David Ben-Gurion and Arab leaders. Sharett opposes aggression or 'adventurism' and believes that Israel needs to be satisfied with the 1949 borders in order for peace to exist in this turmultous region. Even while being a minority in Mapai, he was given the nomination by the party and now serves as Prime Minsiter of Israel."
 israel.9.d:0 "In a remarkable discovery over recent years, scrolls containing ancient Jewish manuscripts have been found in the Qumran Caves. These caves are near the Dead Sea, a Salt Lake located in the hotly contested region of the West Bank. While the scrolls themselves were discovered in 1947, it’s only in more recent years that teams have made efforts to excavate them. As the historical significance of them has become more and more apparent, their value has increased and the search progress has subsequently accelerated rapidly. After five years of excavations, the last scrolls have finally been recovered from the cave. In total there are 972 manuscripts with 7 scrolls, found in a total of 11 caves. The recovery of these ancient scrolls represents a considerable step forward for the study of both the Jewish faith and the Hebrew Language, as the rush to understand the contents of the scrolls has began."
 israel.10.d:0 "After lifting the British restriction on Jewish immigration and securing our independence, the number of Jews moving to Israel from all around the world skyrocketed, with more Sephardi, Moroccan and Yemenite Jews moving in ever increasing numbers. While the state will have to adjust to taking care of such a rapidly increasing population, the immigrants are full of joy and hope upon reaching their new home where they shall finally live free."
 israel.11.d:0 "Ever since the establishment of the country, there was a great debate on what the school curriculum should look like. Mapai and other secular parties want children to have a general education similar to that in the West, while HaPoel HaMizrachi, Mizrachi and other Ultra-Orthodox parties want to introduce religious education to 'revive the Jewish spirit of the nation'. This debate doesn't seem close to ending since Prime Minister Ben-Gurion has to appease both sides in order to keep his increasingly unstable coalition together."
 israel.12.d:0 "The Palmach, which fought valiantly alongside the IDF in the war of Indepdence, has been dissolved and integrated into the mainstream IDF, Ben-Gurion stated that he wants to 'de-politicze' the Palmach, as he sees it as too closely tied to Mapam, which he holds animosity and suspicion towards."
 israel.13.d:0 "Immigration camps, many of which were recently turned into Transition Camps or Ma'abarot in the wake of increasing influx of Jewish Immigrants, are constantly popping up across Israel, while the government did reserve as many apartments and houses they could, even those were not enough to hold the tens of thousands of Jews that arrive each month. Many new immigrants now live in the Ma'abarot, where conditions are harsh, according to a journalist visiting a Ma'abara 'there were two faucets for everyone, About a thousand people. The toilets had no roof and were infested with flies.'"
 israel.14.d:0 "Moshe Dayan has started an initiative to move Bedouins away from the Northern Negev and expell them to the Hebron Hills. This move soon gained controversy after it attracted the attention of Moshe Sharett and the Foreign Ministry who called the initiative 'Stupid'"

 israel.16.d:0 "David Ben-Gurion has appointed Pinchas Lavon, a senior Mapai member to act as Defense Minister after the former served at that post since 1948, many speculate that Prime Minister Ben-Gurion is planning to retire from politics."
 israel.17.d:0 "Mordechai Maklef, who was appointed as Yigal Yadin's replacement following the latter's resignation, has offered his own resignation, after being unable to cooperate with Minister of Defence Pinchas Lavon. the Prime Minister has swiftly appointed the relatively young Moshe Dayan as the new Chief of Staff."
 israel.18.d:0 "Facing electoral defeat, Mapai was sent into a frenzy as Ben-Gurion's leadership position seemed more vulnerable than ever, Levi Eshkol, a 'centrist' in his party and the compromiser figure, was approached by anti Ben-Gurionist figures asking him for his opinion on them ousting Ben-Gurion. The destiny of Mapai depends on Eshkol's decision, Eshkol decides to..."
 israel.19.d:0 "With the aid of Eshkol, David Ben-Gurion has secured his position and prevented a takeover of the party, he now gives party leadership positions to loyalists such as the young Moshe Dayan and Shimon Peres."

 israel.21.d:0 "With the aid of Levi Eshkol, who saw an opportunity to strengthen his position in the party, anti Ben-Gurionists have taken over the Mapai leadership and de-facto ousted Ben-Gurion from the party, they have offered the leadership to Levi Eshkol, who they hoped could bridge the gap between Mapai elders and younger Mapainiks. Levi Eshkol isn't excited to become party leader just yet and suggested the new leadership to name Golda Meir their nominee in case he turns the nomination down. After a short time of deliberation, Eshkol decides to..."

 israelpresidents.1.d:0 "Despite his poor health, Chaim Weizmann has decided to stand for re-election as President of Israel, even though no other candidates stood against him, a vote was held anyway and Weizmann has been elected with an absolute majority of votes in the Knesset and will continue to serve as President."
 israelpresidents.2.d:0 "Chaim Weizmann, the first President of Israel has just passed away at the age of 77 in Rehovot, he was buried alongisde his wife at the Weizmann estate. the academic verdict on his grave says that he was a 'patriot long before Israel even existed'."
 israelpresidents.3.d:0 "After Chaim Weizmann's death, a Presidential election was quickly put in place to elect his successor, after an unusually divisive election between the Mapai candidate, Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, the religious Zionist Mizrachi candidate, Moderchai Nurock and the Independent Yitzhak Gruenbaum. Ben-Zvi has emerged victorious after getting the majority of the votes on the third round. Yitzhak Ben-Zvi will now serve as Israel's second President"
 lavonmania.1.d:0 "David Ben-Gurion, leader of Mapai and Prime Minister of Israel, has decided to retire today, he says that the retirement was for personal non-political reasons. His sudden decision to retire and live in the small Kibbutz in the Negev of Sde Boker has launched Mapai into a scramble to find his replacement. Eventually, Moshe Sharett, Minister of Foreign Affairs has emerged as the party's choice to be Ben-Gurion's replacement and will now fill his place as Prime Minister."
 lavonmania.2.d:0 "Following the agreement between our ally Britain and Egypt, who is hostile to us, to withdraw British forces from the Suez Canal by 1956, the IDF High Command was left nervous watching on. The Suez Canal is an important trading point for Israeli ships, and if Britain withdraws from the canal, Egypt could block Israeli ships from entering the canal. Followling that assesment, some men in the IDF High Command proposed the idea of initiating a false flag operation to bomb British owned businesses near the Canal, in order to give an air of instability and convince the British to withdraw from the treaty and remain in the canal. This idea was largely rejected by most of the IDF High Command who proposed that Israel should try and remain diplomatic without taking any reckless measures."

They talked about the urgency of the situation in Egypt and their reaction to Egyptian nationalization of the Suez Canal. They then planned a 2 stage invasion of Egypt including a cover story to tell the world. The Israeli side feared to be abandoned by France and Britain in the middle of the invasion and thus demanded that all sides sign a document pleading their allegiance to each other. All leaders left the building with copies of the agreement, now all we have to do is to prepare for an invasion of the Sinai peninsula while the Western powers focus on Egypt."
