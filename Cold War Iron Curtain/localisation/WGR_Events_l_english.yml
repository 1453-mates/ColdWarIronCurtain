 wgr.202.d:0 "The Election of 1961 has arrived. For the first time, the SPD has a chancellor-candidate, who is not chairman of the party: Willy Brandt, the Governing Mayor of West Berlin. After the building of the Berlin Wall, he gained more and more sympathy, while chancellor Konrad Adenauer was criticised for not showing enough support for the people of West Berlin. Adenauer had to save the absolute majority of CDU and CSU, but, considering his age and his long term as chancellor, there were big doubts if he should lead the country in a fourth term."
 #wgr.12.t:0 "Starfighter Crisis"
 #wgr.12.d:0 "It would seem our new fighters aren't as good as it seemed as we had several major accidents over last few days. Our experts theoretize that F-104 Starfighter simply isn't designed with our weather conditions in mind. We will have to find some solution."

 wgr.17.t:0 "Loss of Der Alte"
 wgr.17.d:0 "Konrad Hermann Joseph Adenauer, our first Chancellor, the father of Wirtschaftswunder and a belowed man has died in his family home in Rhöndorf.

His state funeral in Cologne Cathedral was attended by a large number of international guests. One hundred and eighty countries were represented, included fifteen world leaders.\nAfter the Requiem Mass and service, his remains were taken upstream to Rhöndorf on the Rhine aboard Kondor, with two more Seeadler-class fast attack craft of the German Navy, Seeadler and Sperber as escorts, \"past the thousands who stood in silence on both banks of the river\". He is interred at the Waldfriedhof at Rhöndorf.\nWhen Germans were asked what they admired most about Adenauer, the majority responded that he had brought home the last German prisoners of war from the USSR, which had become known as the \"Return of the 10,000\"."

 Ostpolitik.2.t:0 "Die Warschauer Vertrag"
 Ostpolitik.2.d:0 "Today sees another victory for Ostpolitik. In Warsaw, West German Chancellor [WGR.GetLeader] and Polish Prime Minister Józef Cyrankiewicz have signed the treaty of Warsaw. The treaty commits both sides to nonviolence along with accepting the existing border—the Oder-Neisse line, imposed on Germany by the Allied powers at the 1945 Potsdam Conference following the end of World War II.\nWhile Poland is happy about the agreement, the same can't be said for West Germany. There, the opposition, has marked this policy as a betrayal of national interests. At the time the treaty was signed, West German commentators sought to maintain that this could not be a final settlement of the Polish border issue, because Article IV of this treaty stated that previous treaties like the Potsdam Agreement were not superseded by this latest agreement; so it might be argued that the provisions of this treaty could be changed by a final peace treaty between Germany and the Allies of World War II—as provided for in the Potsdam Agreement."
 SDP_60s.1.t:0 "SDP Calls For Nuclear Free Europe"
 SDP_60s.1.d:0 "The ruling Social Democrat Party (SDP) of West Germany announced that it was calling for a nuclear free Europe. The government stated the people of Europe have long been held hostage by the nuclear arms race and the superpowers deploying such devastating weapons across Europe. The announcement has garnered support among not just Germans but Europeans across the continent who have felt powerless in the face of the nuclear threat. Across NATO there has been a growing sense of unease at the announcement. Some governments are privately sympathetic while others, especially the United States, view the announcement as potential sabotage that undermines the defense of Europe. There are even groups in the United States who are suggesting the announcement proves the SDP is a Soviet agent designed to sabotage NATO from the inside."
 Stammheim.1.t:0 "Opening of Stammheim Supermax"
 Stammheim.1.d:0 "West Germany opened a new supermax prison in Stuttgart. Called Stammheim Supermax Prison, the government believes the facility will be the most secure facility in the country. Indeed, the prison will not only house prisoners but have its own courthouse in which suspects maybe tried. This will prove especially useful in cases involving dangerous organizations as they will be unable to interfere with the legal process. The new warden noted the prison may end up being the not just the most secure prison in the country but perhaps even in the world. The prison took four years to be constructed and is expected to immediately house some of the most dangerous criminals and suspects."
