 Fulro_1_desc:0 "A new organization has risen from the jungles of Vietnam. From propaganda posters to armed struggles, the United Front for the Liberation  of Oppressed Races have risen up to arms against both South and North Vietnam - clamoring for the rights and autonomy of the Montagnards, they have been determined in their battles. Most say Cambodia and China are the ones responsible for funding and supporting this group. Whether it succeeds in its struggles are still to be seen.\n In 1958, a group of French intellectuals mounted the predecessor to FULRO, whose objective was to defend the Bahnar people, the Jarai, the Rhade and the K'Ho people. Named BAJARAKA, it lived for a short period of time before merging with both the Front for the Liberation of Champa and the Liberation Front of Kampuchea Krom, both groups originated in Cambodia that fought for their respective ethnicities. The Montagnards, The ethnic group that most composed FULRO, are composed of 2.25 million people, with a dozen tribes and various languages spoken."
 North_Vietnam_1_desc:0 "The heart of the founder of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has stopped. Ho Chi Minh lies still and peacefully on his deathbed; heart failure took the founder of Vietnamese Socialism from the nation and has thus left it momentarily leaderless. Born in May of 1890, the elusive Ho Chi Minh was known to use at the very least fifty pseudonyms, with an unknown or at the very least, uncertain place and date of birth, the leader of North Vietnam was loved by many and hated by many others, especially in South Vietnam; a writer, journalist, poet and polyglot – he was an inspirational figure who led the Democratic Republic of Vietnam through turbulent times and was unyielding in his faith that Vietnam is to be united under one banner."
 North_Vietnam_2_desc:0 "\nThe government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has announced that it will begin a series of land reforms in order to benefit the peasantry and the rural workers; while initially adopting a moderate stance and compromising with the landlords in regards to the lands, with a simple reduction in land rent, the North Vietnamese government has started a more hardline and radical reform, being inspired by the Chinese. Deeming landlords as traitorous elements of the cause and forming a special people’s tribunal court; most of which are composed by peasants with little to no expertise regarding law and dishing out arbitrary sentences that vary from death penalty to a few years of harsh labor. Furthermore, a series of decrees and laws on land reform has been released, detailing the last phase of the land revolution, the redistribution of agricultural land."
 North_Vietnam_3_desc:0 "\nAfter the radicalization of the land reform by elements of the Communist Party of Vietnam, it hasn’t taken long for the executions and the social isolation of landlords to begin. With a Politburo document being released that details that one per a thousand people of the total population must be executed, on the grounds of them being landlords or otherwise collaborating with landlords; it has been estimated that fifteen thousand reactionaries and landlords are dead. The VWP has thus far started a campaign on the rectification of errors after the execution of these landlords, many of which have been falsely or wrongly sentenced to death. With a three-phase operation, it has re-classified peasants and has restituted property that has been erroneously expropriated or otherwise making suitable compensation for those mistakes; furthermore, there has been a review, inventory and concentrated re-indoctrination of local personnel."

 Cambodia_Com_1_desc:0 "After the separation of the Indochinese Communist Party into Lao, Vietnamese and Cambodian counterparts, the decision to form a Cambodian communist party was taken. Son Ngoc Minh was appointed the Acting Chairman of the party, being initially named the Khmer People’s Revolutionary Party. It is rumored that the KPRP and the Viet Minh are tied together and maintain very strong relations; and the KPRP is heavily supporting the Vietnamese party in this initial phase of its existence."
 Cambodia_Com_2_desc:0 "A long march has been initiated; the failure of the Viet Minh to negotiate a political role for the KPRP in the Geneva Conference has prompted the Acting Chairman of the KPRP, Son Ngoc Minh, to make a march to North Vietnam with a thousand men. The men that remained in Cambodia have formed a legal political party, the Krom Pracheachon. During the formation of Pracheachon, two new leaders that will manage the party have emerged, Tou Samouth of the Urban Committee and Sieu Heng of the Rural Committee; the Urban Committee has warm views on Norodom Sihanouk and is endorsed by North Vietnam while Sieu Heng was vehemently against Norodom and advocates a struggle to overthrow the “feudalist” Sihanouk."
