 Reagan.103.d:0 "President [USA.GetLeader] has a long history of opposing civil rights laws but insists he is no segregationist. He simply supports the importance of states rights. However, he especially opposes certain provisions of the landmark Civil Rights Act and has instructed senior officials to investigate the possibilities of amending the bill to end restrictions on states. However, opponents say these amendments would remove protections for minorities, strong congressional opposition is expected to any changes. The President is also not expected to utilize executive power to facilitate the enforcement of the act, which many suggest may undermine its impact for minorities."
 Goldwater.1.d:0 "President [USA.GetLeader] announced the federal government will respect States Rights and no longer force a federal agenda on individual states. President [USA.GetLeader] emphasized that federal requirements and court orders must be implemented but stated states must be allowed to implement them on their own terms in order to ensure a stable and friendly atmosphere across the country. The announcement was met with condemnation, especially from activist and civil rights group who argue not forcing states to comply to federal directives will see them perpetuate their systems of injustice and avoid making the drastic changes necessary."
 USAUrban.1.d:0 "After a series of violent protests and unrest across American urban centers, President [USA.GetLeader] announced peace had returned to all American cities. He cited the efforts of law enforcement, along with state and federal officials in combating the unrest. When asked if he would commission an investigation into the recent unrest, the President stated that would be under consideration. Although the unrest has ended, opponents of the President suggest the unrest had simply died out or was forcibly dispersed by government efforts. National Guards units called up or put on alert across the country are expected to stand down."
 Bussing.1.d:0 "President [USA.GetLeader] directed cabinet members and senior officials to direct federal officials to withdraw pressure and funds for states to implement desegregation bussing programs. Bussing programs place and move students to different schools in order to combat segregation and end inequalities between schools based on racial lines. President [USA.GetLeader] stated while he did not oppose the purpose of bussing, he wished to respect the rights of states and local parents. He stated the federal government had no business to interfere so directly in the affairs of state and loca education policy."
 Goldwater.201.d:0 "Across the nation, this morning FBI and local law enforcement officers raided party offices connected to prominent black nationalist organizations. President [USA.GetLeader] addressed the media that afternoon to announce he was directing federal agencies to crackdown on militant black nationalism. The President stated these organizations were engaged in militant activities, arms training, and illegal activities including organized crime. He stated the government feared such groups may soon engage in overt violence against non-blacks and the government. He stated the raids this morning were just the beginning and the campaign would intensify in the upcoming months."
 Goldwater.202.d:0 "President [USA.GetLeader] stated his government would issue an executive order to preserve the principle of states rights. The new order would guarantee states their rights and prohibit the federal government from using force, intimidation, or funding pressure to force states to comply to directives. The announcement was received warmly by southerners opposed to recent federal legal rulings regarding segregation, but in college campuses across the country, protests broke out. In addition, several prominent members of congress stated the President was desecrating the Civil War sacrifices of Union soldiers and citizens."
 Goldwater.200.d:0 "Americans watching the news last night were stunned to see police and national guardsmen brutally breaking up anti-war protests being held on several major university campuses. This follows President [USA.GetLeader] earlier statement that anti-war protestors undermined the United States and aided her enemies abroad. He called the threat immense and stated the government would begin cracking down on such organizations. In addition to the violent breakup of demonstrations, the FBI has raided prominent anti-war organization, seizing thousands of documents. An FBI spokesman stated they expect to prosecute many anti-war leaders for foreign ties and violent communist sympathies."
 Klan.1.d:0 "The recent revival of the infamous Ku Klux Klan and several high-profile incidents of violence against African Americans pushed President [USA.GetLeader] to announce the Attorney General would soon announce charges against Klan leaders involved in the violence. The President stated Klan violence had no place in modern America and declared the government would not stop prosecuting the group until it stopped its violence against American citizens. Many minority communities across the country will welcome the news, though how the Klan will react is unknown as it has a decentralized structure."
 ERA.1.d:0 "The campaign for an Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) was first introduced in 1923. The amendment seeks to end any legal discrimination between the sexes. The changing social and cultural life has revived efforts to pass the ERA. Thousands of women have participated in protests or signed petitions urging Congress to finally approve ERA. Women still face legal hurdles in cases related to divorce and other important issues. College and middle-class women are behind the ERA resurgence, but working-class women oppose ERA, fearing the bill would end labor protection laws passed for preserving women rights at the workplace."
 JFK_Mafia.1.d:0 "President [USA.GetLeader], working closely with the Attorney General, has directed the Department of Justice, the FBI, and the IRS to begin investigations and closely collaborate on cases targeting organized crime in the United States. The President noted that organized crime had flourished due to federal law enforcement focusing on more overt crimes. Although these investigations may take many years to complete, President [USA.GetLeader] hopes cities like Las Vegas and Newport Kentucky will be rid of organized criminal elements. However, this new initiative will no doubt infuriate powerful criminal families and there some concerns within the government of retaliation."
 LBJ_Civil.1.d:0 "After the passing of the Civil Rights Act by President [USA.GetLeader] questions were raised on how to enforce the new law. Many southern communities, including state officials resisted implementing the law. To combat this, the President has decided to launch injunctions, federal prosecutions, and has dispatched officials to trouble spots in order to achieve compliance. The President is also considering signing executive orders to empower federal agencies to make sure the Civil Rights Act gets implemented. However, this approach has alienated some members of Congress who fear a federal overreach may embolden opponents to civil rights."
 Nixon.1960.d:0 "The Dixiecrats emerged as segregationist, dissenting faction in the Democratic Party that ended their dissent in 1948. However, they remained upset with the civil rights situation and the recent Presidential election indicates the southern democrats maybe shifting allegiance. Several traditionally Democratic southern states fall to the Republican candidate. These results have enraged Democratic Party leaders who blamed the Dixiecrat influence and the southern Democrat focus on segregation as turning the south towards the Republicans. Whether the Democrats can resolve this division is unknown, but the Republicans are expected to try and push southern Democrats to join them."
 Nixon_native.1.d:0 "President [USA.GetLeader] laid out his vision for the relationship between the United States and the many Native American communities within the country. He announced the old policy of termination or forced assimilation would be ended in favor of self-determination. The President emphasized Native Americans must make their own choices and decisions. The Bureau of Indian Affairs will dispatch federal funds to recognized tribes to distribute on their terms. Although many tribes have applauded the effort, non-reservation, urban Native Americans have voiced concern that they will be excluded from such resources or at the mercy of elders."
 Rockefeller.1.d:0 "President [USA.GetLeader] has long discussed his concern over welfare spending by the government. The President felt uncontrolled welfare would be detrimental to the development and social character of the country. Upon taking office, President [USA.GetLeader] met with relevant cabinet members and congressional leadership to develop a strategy to control welfare spending and institute several programs, including one which would see welfare recipients capable of working be put into job training programs. The President announced today that his efforts have borne fruit and welfare spending, once thought uncontrollable, has been stabilized."
 Rockefeller.2.d:0 "In a public ceremony, President [USA.GetLeader] officially unveiled his new art initiative. An avid art collector and patron himself, the President proudly stated his new art initiative would see the top artist in the United States not only gain vital funding for projects but also be showcased. He insisted American talent in all fields must be supported and his initiative will help demonstrate American creativity and lead to greater collaboration between the United States and the rest of the world. Although the initiative has been lauded in the press, detractors have called it a vanity project for the President."
 Desegregation.1.d:0 "Following the supreme court decision declaring segregation unconstitutional, military veteran James Meredith attempted to register as a student at the University of Mississippi (also called Ole Miss). Meredith met hostile protestors and the governor refused to protect or support the desegregation of the University. In response, President [USA.GetLeader] today directed the United States Marshals and United States Army to enforce desegregation and deploy to the campus. Meredith is expected to register under the protection of the Marshals and troops but thousands of anti-desegregation protesters are assembling, many fear violence may occur between federal troops and the furious protestors."
 Desegratation.2.d:0 "In the White House today, President [USA.GetLeader] signed Executive Order 11063. The order “…prohibits discrimination in the sale, leasing, rental, or other disposition of properties and facilities owned or operated by the federal government with federal funds.” Segregation has now been banned on all federally funded housing and is being hailed as a great victory in the civil rights movement. More significantly, many hope the order will end the decades long practice of black communities being chronically underfunded by federal funds, especially in communities with a pressing need for such housing."
