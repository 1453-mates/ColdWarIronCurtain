 Yemani_Coup.1.d:0 "Imam Muhammad Al Badr took over the throne of Yemen following his father’s death in 1962. Despite his royal background he long admired Egyptian President Gamal Abdul Nasser and one of his first acts was to promote known Nasserist, Colonel Abdullah Sallal to command the Palace Guard. This despite his father’s anti-Nasser stance and the threat Arab nationalism had already posed to the Imamate. Al Badr’s father brutally crushed a coup attempt in 1955 by Nasserist officers who sought to end the monarchy. In Egypt, President Nasser openly supported anti-royal Yemeni officers and Egyptian diplomats quietly supported multiple plots against Al Badr. Abdullah Sallal, in cooperation with other conspirators, planned to deploy tanks and armed troops to assault Al Badr’s palace on the night of September 26th 1962. The planned coup was put in motion after Sallal learned Al Badr was aware of plots against him. Years of tension between revolutionaries and supporters of the monarchy have now boiled over and it appears Al Badr’s efforts to work with the Nasserist factions may have backfired on him as Sallal’s coup begins to be set in motion."
 Yemani_Coup.2.d:0 " By 11:45 pm on the night of the coup, Colonel Abdullah Sallal’s tanks began pounding the royal palace, Muhammad Al Badr tried to lead a resistance but due to the overwhelming firepower he was forced to escape the palace and has been driven from his capital San’a. Sallal’s forces quickly secured key installations across the city, including the radio station and airport. Other revolutionary officers, many who had been sympathetic to the 1955 coup attempt have started to seize control in other major cities across Yemen. The radio has announced the overthrow of Al Badr and an end to a corrupt monarchy which had crippled the development of Yemen as a people and as a part of the Arab world. Sallal solidified control over the Revolution by purging non-Nasserists and Egypt dispatched senior officers to assess what aid the Sallal regime needed. Despite pronouncements that Al Badr had died during the assault on the palace, the Yemeni King had survived and was making his way north, securing support from tribesmen and settling in Saudi Arabia."
 Yemani_Coup.3.d:0 "On the morning of September 26th, 1962, a royalist officer informed Imam Muhammad Al Badr that his commander of the palace guard and known Nasserist Colonel Abdullah Sallal had opened the armory of the military academy to arm troops and junior officers. In addition, Sallal informed Al Badr that tanks were going to be moved that night near the palace and Al Badr should not be concerned. Suspicious of these actions, Al Badr called on loyal officers and soldiers to meet with him and just a few hours before Sallal’s tanks were to be moved into position to assault the palace, Al Badr had Sallal arrested and cancelled orders to move the tanks. A concurrent plot to send an armored car and secure the radio station and airport by Lieutenant Ali Abdul Moghny was easily broken up through his men did briefly seize the radio station. Within hours the coup plot has been broken and its main conspirators either in custody or on the run."
 Tiran_Closing.1.d:0 "In the latest escalation at the Sinai, Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser has announced the closing of the Straits of Tiran to Israeli ships or goods destined for the country. Egypt declared any Israeli ships who attempt to violate the blockade will be fired upon and that the Straits have been mined. This news follows the re-militarization of the Sinai by Egyptian forces on May 14th and the Egyptian demand for the expulsion of UN peacekeepers from the Sinai on May 16th. Nasser has declared, "We are ready for war... These waters are ours If Israel wishes to threaten war, we tell her: "You are welcome." Earlier this month, Israeli Prime Minister Levi Eshkol repeated the warning issued by the Israeli government in 1957 that any closure of the Straits would be seen as an act of war. Thus far, the Israeli government remains quiet on Nasser's open challenge to the Israeli warning. Reports have arrived of Israeli tank movements in the Negev in response to the Egyptian deployments in the Sinai. In Tensions are mounting in the region as the UN and international diplomats scramble to try and resolve the crisis before it escalates further. Israel reportedly receives 90 percent of its oil through the Straits and many observers view this as a grave threat to the Israeli economy. Egyptians and Arabs across the region have been galvanized by Nasser's actions and eagerly support his policy of escalation and aggressiveness towards Israel in the Sinai."
 aswan.100.d:0 "Over 10 years after construction started, Egypt finally completed the Awan Dam. The project saw tens of thousands of Egyptian engineers and workers, with the help of Soviet financing and expertise, complete this massive project. This success represents a great achievement for Arab-Soviet cooperation. With the Aswan Dam, Egypt hopes to utilize the Nile for its hydroelectricity, help control flooding, and lead to an agricultural boom for the country. The reservoir has been named Lake Nasser after Egypt's visionary President Gamal Abdel Nasser. Plans for the dam started in the early 1950s and became a key component to Nasser's plans to modernize Egypt. Initially, Nasser utilized Egypt's non-aligned position to attract both American and Soviet support for Egypt's military buildup and economic development. However, America and Britain withdrew aid, specifically for the dam due to Nasser's arms deals with the Soviets and foreign policy. However, Nasser countered these setbacks by nationalizing the Suez Canal, hoping to utilize the income from it to fund the dam and secured Soviet financing. These actions cemented his status as an anti-imperialist and leader of the Arab World. The completion of this project represents independent Egypt's greatest development project since escaping the yoke of Western imperialism and many Egyptians are optimistic this will lead to an economic golden age."
 black_saturday.1.d:0 "The unrest began at Almaza Airport, when workers there refused to provide services to British airplanes. It was followed by the rebellion of policemen, who wished to express their solidarity with their dead and captured colleagues. Protesters then headed towards the university building, where they were joined by students. Together they marched towards the prime minister's office to demand that Egypt break its diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom and declare war on it. They were told that the government wished to do so, but faced opposition from the king. As a result, protesters went to Abdeen Palace and expressed its discontent towards the king, his partisans and the British.\nThe first act of arson took place in Opera Square where fire spread to multiple shops, corporate offices, movie theaters, hotels and banks. The fires also reached the neighbourhoods of Faggala, Daher, Citadel, as well as Tahrir Square and Cairo Train Station Square. Due to the prevailing chaos, theft and looting occurred until the Egyptian Army arrived shortly before sunset and managed to restore order. The Army was alerted belatedly, after most of the damage had already occurred. A total of 3.4 million pounds of damage was done to British and foreign property. As for the human casualties, 26 people died and 552 suffered injuries."
 farouk_gang.6:0 "Everything is set for the upcoming military parade. Tanks have been fueled, guns have been shined and soldiers have been fed. Soon everyone will know that our military might is strong and rebelling or attacking us would be useless!"
 egy_trial.2.d:0 "Now that Naguib has secured his supremacy over Nasser, it is time to decide what to do with him. Firstly, We can let him live a normal life in Cairo. If we want to punish him, we can force him into exile and ban him from ever coming back or we could imprison him for several years."
 egy_trial.3.d:0 "Very few people remember the name Gamal Abdel Nasser. Once one of the leading members of the Revolutionary Command Council, he eventually tried to overthrow Naguib which ended in his failure. After the failed coup he dissapeared from politics and according to anonymous sources, is currently living somewhere in Cairo."
 egy_trial.4.d:0 "Gamal Abdel Nasser, once a major figure in Revolutionary Command Council has just been forced into exile. Reports indicate that he was escorted to the airport in gunpoint where he boarded a plane to a unknown destenation. Outside the airport several people were  protesting against this, claiming that Nasser was Egypts salvation and now Egypt is doomed."
 egy_trial.5.d:0 "Breaking news from Cairos court house. Gamal Abdel Nasser, former high ranking member of the Revolutionary Command Council has just been sentenced to 15 years in jail due to his attempted coup of president Naguib. Nasser will serve his time in the Tora Prison."

 farouk_gang.1.d:0 "King Farouk has announced today that all red cars in Egypt are banned effective immediately and only he is allowed to own any. The only exceptions are the military jeeps, painted red, that travel as part of the king's entourage.\nThe king is known for his fleet of expensive cars, including a 1947 fiery red Bentley Mark VI and a red Mercedes Benz 540K which was a gift from Adolf Hitler.\nMuch of King Farouk's loyalists have praised the law stating that the King should be the only one who is worthy to use such vehicles. Anonymous opponents have criticized the law as "absolutely insane" and "completely meaningless". Several individuals have come to the anonymous interview simply to state that the king has shot their tires while they were trying to pass him. The king called these accusations "unproven"."
 farouk_gang.2.d:0 "Princess Fathia has been banned from Egypt after an affair with Riyad Ghali. Recently, it has become public note that Riyad Ghali, royal advisor to the King of Egypt, has proposed to Princess Fathia of Egypt. Despite strong objections from King Farouk, the marriage proceeded at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco. It was also brought to light that both of them have converted to Catholicism and plan to live together. In response, King Farouk has announced that Princess Fathia are banned from Egypt and excommunicated. All of their possessions still in Egypt have been confiscated by the state."
 farouk_gang.3.d:0 "The king has returned from his diplomatic trip to France. According to him, the trip was fruitful and will surely improve the relations between Egypt and France. However, anonymous sources state that the trip was a massive failure. First of all, during the official party held in Paris, Farouk reportedly pick-pocketed watches, wallets and cigarette lighters. Then, during his free time he went on a 70-hour gambling ramapge, during which he supposedly lost 150,000 dollars, got blackout drunk and assaulted a woman for not sleeping with him. Of course, all of these are just rumors and surely made up by someone jealous of the king."
 farouk_gang.4.d:0 "The king has just returned from his trip to France. First he travelled to Deauville, leaving Alexandria on his yacht with a destroyer as an escort and landed at Marseilles. Farouk together his entourage consisting of his "kitchen cabinet", 30 Albanian bodyguards, assorted Egyptian secretaries and doctors, Sudanese food tasters and various other followers traveled across the French countryside in a column of 7 Cadillacs surrounded by motorcycle-riding bodyguards and an airplane flying overhead with orders to land in case Farouk wanted to fly instead. At the casino he won around 40 million marcs.\nFrom Deauville, Farouk went to Biarritz, where he met with the former King Edward VIII. He then crossed over to San Sebastian in Spain to attend a film festival with four "of his ladies of the moment" as the British ambassador to Spain called them.\nFarouk's next stop was Cannes, where he engaged in a $80,000 game of baccarat at the Palm Beach Casino with people such as the Hollywood mogul Jack L. Warner and the British industrialist Myers Hyman. Hyman won the game and then promptly died of a heart-attack, leading to newspaper headlines such as "Lucky Mickie Beats Farouk-and Dies!" Finally, Farouk ended his bachelor party in San Remo in Italy where he purchased a number of Roman antiques at an auction and afterwards arrived in Alexandria"
 free_officer_fail.1.d:0 "After sieging King Farouk's palace, the Free Officers decided to mount an attack. They were up against approximately 800 well-rested and well equipped Sudanese guardsmen who were loyal to the king. In the evening, the Free Officers began an assault against King Farouk. King Farouk, who was an expert marksman, also participated in the fight killing approximately 16 attackers who were attempting to cross the Palace grounds. The Free Officers, desperate to maintain the offensive and kill the King, decided against a withdrawal. Unable to pierce the fortified palace and being constantly harassed by the King himself from a distance, the Free Officers sustained extreme casualties. After the attack, King Farouk immediately ordered a counter-attack against the now disorganized and severely wounded Free Officer siege camp. Poorly defended, all of the Free Officers with the exception of Nasser, were killed. Approximately 30 of the remaining seigers surrendered but King Farouk executed them personally because he would not tolerate treason. Our noble King Farouk today has declared a state of emergency. There is now a manhunt underway to find the traitorous Nasser and bring him to justice. Additionally, the King has called on all patriotic Egyptians to enlist in the army as he is beginning a large buildup to maintain security in the region."
 nasser_execution.1.d:0 "The hunt for Nasser has finally come to a close. After a long and arduous manhunt, Egyptian police found the traitorous Nasser held up in a cell inside of Cairo. After establishing a blockade, the Sudanese guard was called in to arrest Nasser and kill the defenders of the building. Nasser was brought before King Farouk where he stood a fair and just trial for his crimes. It was ultimately decided that his crime must be capitally punished and was executed by strangulation personally by King Farouk."
 sudan_part.1.d:0 "The fight against British rule had the Sudanese region embroiled in a terrible conflict. Our noble King Farouk desiring to maintain order and peace, established a peacekeeping mission. Not wanting to contribute to the conflict, Egyptian forces built garrisons and administrative headquarters to ensure order. After 4 years, the conflict has finally come to an end with the British colonial garrison withdrawing and Sudanese forces almost depleted. Because the only remaining organized Sudanese force remains in the south, King Farouk has established control over the anarchic Sudanese region. The South Sudanese government has sent a formal protest to the King over this, but King Farouk responded stating they were in no condition to govern the ravaged north. King Farouk has openly admitted to the Egyptian people that he is not sure South Sudan is even a functional government in its current state. He is currently considering sending peacekeepers to the South to establish order there, too."
 farouk_exiled.1.d:0 "Shortly after the overthrow of the former King, the new government quickly decided to auction off the King's vast collection of trinkets and treasures, including his seven-piece bedroom suite that was inspired by Napoleon and Josephine's suite at the Château de Malmaison. Among the more famous of his possessions was one of the rare 1933 Double Eagle coins, though the coin disappeared before it could be returned to the United States. Attracting much prurient interest both in Egypt and abroad was the revelation that Farouk owned one of the largest collections of pornography in the world as he possessed a vast collection numbering into the hundreds of thousands of pornographic photographs, postcards, calendars, playing cards, watches, glasses, cockscrews and so on. Farouk's obsession with collecting also ranged into diamonds, dogs, stamps, rubies, Faberge eggs, ancient Tibetan coins, medieval suits of armor, aspirin bottles, razor blades, paper clips and Geiger counters. At the Koubbeh Palace, it was discovered that Farouk had collected 2,000 silk shirts, 10,000 silk ties, 50 diamond-studded golden walking sticks and one autographed portrait of Adolf Hitler."
 Free_Officer_Coup.1.d:0 "The Free Officer Coup has just succeeded in Cairo and will result in the expelling of King Farouk from the country. King Farouk had long been considered an inept and corrupt ruler by the Free Officers and today their siege has succeeded. Upon hearing that the Free Officers were planning a coup, King Farouk ordered their arrest. However, the Free Officers found out about this order and decided to launch a preemptive attack and evade the arrest. With the inability to arrest the Free Officers, King Farouk got the assistance of the loyal Sudanese guard to fortify his palace. In the evening, the Free Officers mounted a siege and attacked. They were unable to break the fortifications in the palace and were forced to fall back. King Farouk himself killed 4 attackers with his sniper rifle from a makeshift embrasure on his balcony. The next day, armored reinforcements arrived for the Free Officers. The Free Officers issued an ultimatum to King Farouk to surrender, threatening to destroy the palace with artillery. With no way to destroy the reinforcements, King Farouk surrendered."
 Sudan.1.d:0 "After the revolution of 1952 in Egypt broke off the ability for the UK's forces to reach Sudan, Sudan was able to rebel against the UK and gain its independence easily. However, not all is happy in the Sudanese region. There is a massive level of political fractionalization and huge ideological and ethnic divides in the country. The new Sudanese government cannot even decide on how to comprise the new government or a fair way to decide which one should rule the country. The most pressing issues include the lack of civil service workers, a lack of industrialization to support the independent nation, rebellion in the South, and many other problems. If the country is unable to resolve these issues, it may experience serious problems in the coming years."
 abolish_mon_egy.1.d:0 "The transitional government of Egypt has abolished the monarchy. The rule of King Farouk's son, King Faud II, was very short lived as his appointment was only a ruse to appease the British. Gamal Abdel Nasser has been appointed deputy premier and General Naguib has has been appointed as the first president. With the abolition of the monarchy came the newly founded Constitution of the Republic of Egypt. The Constitution has promised secularism and civil rights.\nThere are, however, many individuals who were loyal to the king who are angry that they will no longer receive benefits and spoils from the king. Angrier than the former officers and loyalists, the Muslim Brotherhood is staunchly opposed to the secularism of the new republic and may cause issues for the newly founded Republic if not dealt with."
 egy_trial.1.d:0 "The Royal Officers, military officers loyal to the King, are being put on trial for collusion in crimes against Egypt. The charges include things such as general corruption and abuse of power but many officers are being brought to trial for specific offenses such as brutality or direct theft. The trials will take a long period of time and more complex cases where evidence is hard to gather will likely last for months. Already, some officers have attempted to flee the country in an attempt to escape potential punishment."
 egy_rioting.1.d:0 "After months of firebranding, the Islamic Brotherhood is currently participating in a massive statewide riot. The Islamic Brotherhood has, since the first drafting of the Egyptian Constitution, despised the newly founded Republic. Their primary complaints are the secularization of the country and the liberalization of the Muslim faith under the political atmosphere of the government. Many leading theorists such as Sayyid Qutb have published works declaring that Egypt has become no longer Islamic and that the state must be overthrown. Already, rioters have taken over key regions in multiple cities across Egypt and are destroying government property en masse. Government security forces are clashing heavily with the rioters in the streets."
 egy_suez_funding.1.d:0 "The Aswan High Dam has finally received funding and will be built across the Nile. The Dam is expected to span ~3800 meters with a tremendous height of ~110m. The dam will support industrialization with its electricity, control flooding, provide water infrastructure, and irrigate farmlands for large distances. Additionally, the dam will create a lake that has been prematurely named "Lake Nasser" after the revolutionary leader. Currently the Egyptian government is beginning mass hirings and contractings in order to accumulate the manpower and resources necessary to build the dam now that the funding has been secured."
