 YUG_INTEGRATION.2.d:0 "The Yugoslavian communist party played a major role during World War II to support the Albanian communists and the liberation of Albania from the Axis. When the Albanian communists took over the government after the war, they were still beholden to Yugoslavia due to the wartime links and presence of Yugoslavian soldiers within the country. Recently, Yugoslavia used its influence to push for a purge of anti-Yugoslavian Albanian communist leaders. With these opponents to Yugoslavia influence in prison or removed from power, the Albanian government proved quite willing to accept a proposal from Belgrade for the integration of Albania to Yugoslavia. Integration will benefit the people and make any issues with regards to borders and ethnicities mute. The integration marks the continued march of revolution across a unified Balkans."
 YUG_INTEGRATION.3.d:0 "The communist parties of Yugoslavia and Bulgaria have long cooperated and supported one another. The two parties were always strong proponents of uniting the Balkan states under a communist regime to better spread Marxism to the people. Since the end of World War II both nations have resolved the Macedonia question and held extensive discussions on unification. These discussions and negotiations have paid off following the recent decision of the Bulgarian communist party to accept the invitation of Yugoslavia and integrate Bulgaria into it. The Yugoslavian government noted this decision has strengthened the people and communists in both nations and ended any border or ethnic disputes. Yugoslavia is becoming a homeland for all the peoples of the Balkan and under communism, everyone will be equal and grow together. For the Bulgarian communists this decision reflects on their long-held belief in unification of communist regimes across the Balkans."
 YUG_INTEGRATION.1.d:0 "The people of Greece and Yugoslavia both suffered horribly during World War II and many felt abandoned by their pre-war leaders. It was the communist parties of both nations which spearheaded the resistance and eventual liberation. However, where the Yugoslavian communist party succeeded in cementing its control, in Greece the communists had to battle against reactionary forces and foreign interference before triumphing. Yugoslavia recently asked the Greek government to integrate itself and firmly secure their revolutionary victory. After much internal discussion, the Greek government agreed. They believe alone the country risks a counter-revolutionary uprising or interference in their affairs, but unified with Yugoslavia, the state will be too powerful to be challenged. Yugoslavia argues by unifying all the peoples of the Balkans it will end any border or ethnic disputes and more effectively implement communism for the people."
 YUG_GREEK_CIVIL_WAR.1.d:0 "The people of Greece and Yugoslavia were both early victims of Axis aggression and were abandoned by their leaders and allies. Through immense sacrifice, it was the people left behind who freed themselves and only under the leadership of their communist parties. In Yugoslavia the communists secured their position after the war, however, in Greece, the communist party finds itself battling reactionary Greeks. These enemies of the Greek people are only existing because they are openly backed by imperialist powers and are using the services of Greek collaborators to the Nazis. The Central Committee in Belgrade recognizes this situation and has announced it will send Yugoslav men, weapons, and support for the Greek communists and aid them in their struggle. Their eventual victory will be a victory for not just the people of Greece but all the peoples of the Balkans fighting for revolution."
