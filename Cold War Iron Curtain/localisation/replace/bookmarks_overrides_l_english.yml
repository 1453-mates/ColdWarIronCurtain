 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "The Iron Curtain"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The post-war optimism of global cooperation and peace epitomized by the establishment of the United Nations has quickly evaporated. During the last war European empires exhausted not only their own blood and treasure but also that of their colonial territories. Now, colonized peoples across Africa and Asia are demanding independence. Globally, the United States and the Soviet Union now greatly surpass any other power. The beginnings of an ideological rivalry between the two states sees their wartime friendship quickly cool. Already lines are being drawn across Europe as an ideological partition increasingly separates the capitalist and communist regimes."
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The era of British Imperialism has come to an end. The allure of independence is far too great for those subjugated under the British crown. Her colonies around the world are seeing increases in popularity for Nationalist and Communist movements alike. As the United Kingdom's global power wanes, it looks to its Western allies to safeguard against the threat of Communism, now closer than ever. Long gone are the fears of Oswald Mosley, now the fear of Communism grips the hearts of the British Commonwealth."
 PRC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Japanese have been defeated and the ceasefire with the Kuomintang has broken. The People's Liberation Army has grown exponentially and with the equipment left behind by the Japanese, the People's Republic is prepared the secure the rest of China. Despite minimal assistance from the Soviet Union, the leadership of Mao Ze Dong following the Great March has allowed Chinese Communism to flourish. Just a few more key cities, and China shall finally be united!"
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Thanks to the sacrifice of millions of brave Communists, Fascism has for the most part been wiped off of the Earth. But behind the fallen monster hides an even greater threat. The threat of Capitalism. Only having just liberated themselves, the Soviet Union must stand up to protect the world from yet another imperialistic system. The people of the world require a strong guiding hand, and there is no better candidate than the Soviet Union. Communism is gaining momentum, and Joseph Stalin intends to keep it that way."
 USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With the United States victory in the Second World War, it has positioned itself as the champion of Western Democracy. Strongly upholding its Capitalist values, it vehemently opposes the Communist East, led by the Soviet Union. Instead of demilitarizing after the destruction caused by WW2, the nation's military continues to grow to face the red menace. But now that nukes are on the table for both sides, could the United States and the West truly survive against such a formidable foe?"
 YUG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Following the Yugoslav-Soviet split in 1948, Tito's model of Market Socialism was working well with funding from the United State' Marshall Plan. Yugoslavia, while being greatly damaged by Italian and German occupation found themselves with a better quality of living than any other Communist state. However, their political stability was something else entirely. Tito was beloved by his countrymen, but his strategy of neutrality was despised by both East and West. With constant threats from both sides, can Yugoslavia maintain itself as an independent Socialist country?"
 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Japans imperial ambitions were crushed by the allies. Now under American occupation, this former imperial power is now trying to recover from the devastating firebombing campaign it faced during World war 2. How will Japanese future look? Will they be embrace the new democratic path or do something more radical?"
 RAJ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After centuries of foreign oppression, the newly proclaimed Dominion of India, has finally earned it's place on the world stage, and through the carnage of two world wars, the threat of famine and the terrible onslaught in the Pacific War, the Indian people are on the verge of attaining the independence that so many have fought and died in the hopes of achieving.\nBut such efforts carry a heavy price; the fires lit in the hearts of the Indian people by the likes Gandhi could become a nationalist inferno if left unchecked, and with the legacy of Subhas Chandra Bose's failed 'Azad Hind' in the east combined with anger over the newly created states of Pakistan and Myanmar, the Indian people must tread carefully if their new nation is to survive.The Indian people must tread carefully if the new nation of India is to survive."
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "France is heavily split. From the Renault Strike in 1947 to the bread riots of Le Mans and Verdun and the occupation of communist newspapers, the country is ready to fall into chaos. It must also face rebellions in Madagascar and Indochina, but must ensure that its home does not fall into rebellion as well. Rationing and strikes have characterized France this far, but it is impossible to ration a country forever. Will France and its empire endure or fall?"
 CHI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Eight Years War Of Resistance has finally ended with the explosive finale to Japanese imperialism. This is, of course, cause for much celebration - but the Kuomintang government cannot afford to celebrate to the point of distraction. There is still great danger to the nationalist governments, for with the lack of threat from Japan, China has become divided once more. Thanks to Soviet help, the Chinese Communists under Mao Zedong have greatly expanded the territory they occupy, to the point of being a dangerous rival to the ROC. For now, the Chinese Civil War rages on and every effort must be spent on crushing the communists."
 ITA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The feverish pitch after the death of Mussolini has subsided. The declaration of the Republic in 1948 is a high point in this new Italy, but it must still deal with the small impacts of occupation and the growing Communist movement."
