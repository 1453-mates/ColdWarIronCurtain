 SIX_DAYS_WAR.100.d:0 "The Ministry of Defense has recently received a proposal from junior intelligence officers to implement an upgrade of the telecommunication capabilities of government and military institutions. The proposal notes the current system is decades old and according to analysis, appears vulnerable to enemy interception. More significantly, they note a high stress on the system, like during wartime may lead to breakdowns which would severely limit the ability of commanders to direct forces. When senior officers and ministers were act their opinion, they stated the current system is more than capable and the proposal appears to be an effort by these junior officers to elevate their position and profit from the process. Indeed, it is noted the upgrade proposed would be quite costly and may impact the acquisition of vital equipment for the military. With this in mind, the government must consider whether to approve the proposal or not to."
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.1.d:0 "The Israeli forces launched their pre-emptive invasion of the Sinai. The Egyptian Army quickly found itself facing a concentrated attack in the northern and central Sinai, against their expectations. Rapidly moving Israeli ground units were flanking and overwhelming Egyptian units on the border. Within hours of hostilities beginning, the Egyptian forces were in almost total disarray, with units being cutoff and communication systems becoming overwhelmed. The senior leadership in Cairo does not appear to grasp the situation on the ground and now it appears the resistance of the Egyptian Army is collapsing. Many forces are already retreating to the Suez."
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.2.d:0 "We must soon call the leaders of Syria and Jordan to inform them of the current situation in the Sinai. Some advisors believe we should inform them the truth of the situations. That we have taken heavy losses in material and soldiers. More importantly, that the situation in the Sinai has deteriorated to into a full route for our forces. Other advisors fear that revealing such news will cause them to betray the Arab cause and leave us to face the Zionist enemy alone. They want us to dismiss Israeli claims of victories as propaganda and state we have inflicted heavy losses on their aircraft and our forces are about to enter the borders of the Zionist nation itself. Doing so will push them to intervene and reduce the pressure on our forces. With the time to make the call approaching we must decide whether to tell the truth or not."
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.3.d:0 "With news that our brothers in Egypt face the Zionists in a brutal struggle, we have decided to launch our own assaults on the Zionists. This will liberate Arab lands and put enough pressure on their borders that the corrupt house of lies and false nation will soon collapse. The military commanders on the ground believe the enemy is concentrated in the Sinai and our forces will easily overwhelm the weak forces on our borders. Victory will be decisively achieved. Although initial reports indicate a heavy resistance from the enemy, we expect news of victories to follow soon. We are upholding our sacred vows to the Arab people."
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.5.d:0 "Our combined offensive into the Zionist homeland has proven to be a magnificent success. Their soldiers and people lacked the resolve to resist the bravery and skill of our brave soldiers and pilots. People have taken to the streets across the Arab World in celebration of our great victory. Thousands of Arabs who had been displaced during the Nakba eagerly await the opportunity for a return to liberated land. For the moment the joint Arab military command will continue to function to deal with prisoners, patrolling the ceasefire line, and ensuring the Zionists do not try any tricks. But at the moment it is clear to the world we have triumphed."
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.8.d:0 "Our brothers in Egypt informed us of the true situation in the Sinai. We are aware of the setbacks being suffered by them and the continued Zionist aggression. Many of our advisors are urging us to remain neutral and not intervene in the conflict. They fear the Zionists are far more dangerous than thought and the time is not right. Perhaps in time we can come together, better prepared and ready for action. Others, however, are urging us to act in the name of Arab unity to save the situation. They point out the people will be furious if we fail to aid our brothers in Egypt. They also note the military situation may turn insurmountable if we delay action. The decision we make to intervene or not may well decide the destiny of the region."
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.17.d:0 "The cowardly Zionist attempt to destroy our Air Force ended in failure for them. This naked act of aggression cannot go uncalled for. The leadership approved orders for our brave forces in the Sinai to take the battle to the enemy and invade the land they stole in 1948. The officers and soldiers are confident and in high spirits following the recent success. They have waited years for this order and the time is right. We expect the Zionists to resist but are confident that with the initiative our forces will overwhelm any opposition. With our airpower preserved this will greatly aid our advance."
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.18.d:0 "Following the failed preemptive strike by Zionists against the Egyptian Air Force, our Arab brother responded by invading from the Sinai. Without air superiority or the element of surprise, the Zionists face a daunting challenge. The popular mood among the people is that we must act in solidarity and use our forces to break the enemy lines and secure a victory. With our own air power and land forces added to the struggle, this may prove the decisive action and avenge the humiliation of the Nakba. After close consultations, it was agreed to act. Within hours of this decision, the brave Arab soldiers of Syria and Jordan went into action."
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.21.d:0 "The President in Cairo received a message from Eilat that the Zionist fortress had fallen. This marks the biggest achievement of or armed forces in this conflict. The Arab World has always looked up to us to be its Prussia and so far, we have exceeded those expectations. Through toughness and skill our forces have expertly advanced into the western Negev desert, liberating Arab lands and Bedouin tribes. From there we moved towards the Zionist city of Eilat. Its Red Sea port and airfield are essential for the Zionist economy and its loss is not just a major economic blow but will leave their economy vulnerable in the future. Already the military commander has been authorized to establish a military government in Eilat and keep its Zionists residents under control to prevent any fifth columns from emerging."
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.25.d:0 "Ever since the Nakba the Zionists have engaged in a vicious campaign of violence and oppression against the Arabs. They interfere in our affairs and inflict pain on innocents, especially those who were expelled from their ancient homes. In recent years we have built an impressive war machine, the pride of the Arab World. In addition, the current international situation and the fervor of our people favors action and the time has come to prove that we are the Prussia of the Arabs. After receiving orders from Cairo, our powerful military forces in the Sinai sprang into action and began their advance into occupied Arab lands long exploited by the Zionists. Although the international community will not appreciate this action, we have taken the element of surprise and initiative from the enemy, which will no doubt help us overcome the Zionist defenses."
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.35.d:0 "The Israeli government has agreed to capitulate to Syrian demands on water rights for the Jordan River. This was the principle demand of Syria following its victory during the recent war with Israel. The Syrian military joined with fellow Arab states Jordan and Egypt to defeat Israel. Although the Israelis were able to prevent a total capitulation, it was forced to make territorial and economic concessions with its foes. For Syria, the dispute over water rights has dominated its conflict with Israel. Both states long accused the other of trying to steal water which is essential for both economies. Syria hopes with the rights now secured following its victory, it will be able to have an agricultural revolution. In Israel there is widespread fear this concession will lead to water shortages and economic disaster."
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.36.d:0 "Although the Jordanians appeared to be the most reluctant of the Arab states involved in the recent war with Israel, it did commit its forces and emerged victorious in the conflict, alongside its allies. Although Israel avoided a complete capitulation, its military defeat means it must make economic and territorial concessions to its opponents. After intense discussions, the Jordanians announced Israel would cede Jezreel and the area around it. The Jordanians claim they have liberated the Arabs, especially the Arab Christians of the area and their holy lands from the oppressive Israeli occupation regime. News of the agreement is seeing many Arab refugees from 1948 move towards the border in order to return home. Residents wishing to remain with Israel are being asked to either leave or accept the new Jordanian administration."
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.37.d:0 "The United Arab Republic (UAR) signed its final agreement to end the recent war between it and Israel. In the agreement, Israel has agreed to cede the western Negev to occupying UAR forces. During the war, UAR forces had advanced as far as Eilat, but a counteroffensive before the ceasefire saw Israel reclaim Eilat. This last-minute victory ensured Israel only ended up having to cede a thinly populated desert region instead of losing a vital city and port. The UAR is portraying the agreement as a total victory, claiming it had liberated the Arab Bedouin in the area and are now placed to punish the Israeli homeland if it tries future aggressions. Many in Cairo took to the streets to celebrate the announcement, but many observers note the Israelis will likely be relieved that they kept Eilat which may prove vital to its post-war reconstruction."
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.38.d:0 "The United Arab Republic (UAR) signed its final agreement to end the recent war between it and Israel. In the agreement, Israel has agreed to cede the western Negev and Eilat to occupying UAR forces. During the war, UAR and Israeli forces engaged in brutal battles, but the UAR forces were able to advance and capture Eilat. A late counterattack by Israel to recapture the city ended in failure and many in Israel view the loss of Eilat as catastrophic. For the UAR, the mood is ecstatic as people have taken to the street. The UAR government announced the agreement confirms its victory. They claim to have liberated occupied Arab lands and Bedouin residents of its new territories. It also added that by controlling Eilat, the UAR now has a bridge to the rest of the Arab World."
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.39.d:0 "Despite their extensive propaganda campaign, Egypt cannot hide the reality that they have suffered a crushing defeat in the hands of Israel. Israeli forces now control the Sinai and occupy the Palestinian Arabs in Gaza. The Egyptian military, despite its prewar claims of superiority proved incapable of handling the Israeli military which utilized effective tactics, coordination, and skill to achieve its stunning victory. Many in Israel support the occupation of the Sinai, believing it offers Israel a buffer from which to monitor and control future Egyptian aggression. Already the Egyptian government and its allies are condemning the Israeli occupation, claiming it to be illegal and a threat to future peace in the region. Regardless, Israel remains triumphant and its gains unchallenged." #Israeli Victory Against the UAR (Global)
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.40.d:0 "The Israeli government today confirmed its victory over Syria by announcing it will continue to hold the Golan Heights. The Golan Heights and its difficult terrain appeared to be the main advantage for Syrian forces on the defensive. However, during the recent war, Israeli forces managed to overwhelm and capture the area from the Syrian military. Syrian forces failed to successfully counterattack or halt the Israeli forces. With the ceasefire it became clear the Israelis had taken the Golan and Syrian military efforts had largely ended. With this victory, many in Israel believe the nation has gained a natural defensive border to better protect the country from future aggression by Syria." #Israeli Victory Against Syria (Global)
 SIX_DAYS_WAR.41.d:0 "The Jordanian government acknowledged that the West Bank remains under the occupation of Israeli forces. This confirms the major victory achieved by Israel in the recent war. Israeli forces were able to defeat the Jordanians and secured the West Bank in order to better support its other gains and ensure the security of Jerusalem. The West Bank is home to many Arab Palestinians and is currently under an Israeli military government. Israelis are said to be overjoyed with these victories. There is also immense international pressure on Israel and the Arab states to not see a repeat of the refugee crisis of 1948. Many residents in the West Bank are currently unsure about the future. The Jordanians are largely humiliated and are now east of the Jordan River. In Israel many feel the country now has space for the nation to grow in prosperity." #Israeli Victory Against Jordan (Global)
