 #1960s PRC
 CulRevPurge.1.d:0 "Chairman Mao and his supporters have utilized direct denouncements, targeted articles in party newspapers, and the use of political allies to orchestrate a series of purges against senior members of the Chinese Communist Party. These purges are removing moderates who in recent years gained prominence in order to restore the Chinese economy and stability. However, these purges are necessary for Mao and his supporters to take control of key positions and to rehabilitate the image of Mao as the true leader of the revolution in China. Those targeted by the purges are often being removed from political posts and in more extreme cases are being arrested for counter-revolutionary activity."
 Enlais_Tour.1.d:0 "Prominent Chinese communist leader and former Foreign Minister, Premier Zhou Enlai has embarked on a global tour. Enlai plans on visiting many countries, especially in Africa and the Middle East where he hopes to demonstrate Chinese power and influence. The trip will demonstrate China is a global force and is looking beyond its borders. The Chinese are eager to demonstrate its support for the revolutionary struggles currently taking place against reactionary and imperialist regimes. Another major objective of the Premier is to lobby support among the newly emerging independent states to build support for China at the United Nations."
 PRCUN.1.d:0 "Decolonization has seen the emergence of a new Third World of powers, mostly concentrated in Africa and Asia. These states possess a great deal of optimism, youth, and opportunity that China cannot ignore. More importantly, many of these states only achieved independence through revolutionary action against colonial masters. The Chinese government is reaching out and lobbying with these governments to offer their support for the PRC at the United Nations where many of the former colonial powers and the United States continue to hinder handing us our rightful place within the global community. We must rally the Third World and teach its leaders to support us against the imperialist machinations at the United Nations."
 CulRev.11.d:0 "Under the direction of youth leaders and devoted party activists, millions of books are being ripped out of libraries, cultural, and religious centers to be burned in public bonfires. Books that discuss counter-revolutionary ideas, contradict the guidance of Mao, historical works, religious texts, or works of fiction that glorify the reactionary past are all among the works being collected for burnings. To cleanse China and purify the party, a direct destruction of the past and its impurities is essential. Mao teaches for new revolutionary literature and art to emerge, the past must be cleansed and not allowed to interfere with the continuous revolution. Anyone who opposed the burnings or tried to stop the collection of books were detained and will be tried as reactionaries."
 CulRev.12.d:0 "One of the main stumbling blocks to continuous revolution and ending the influence of the reactionary past is the continued existence of glorified graves of noble and revered leaders from the past. These grave sites become spaces of false worship and glorification, especially of people who had exploited and oppressed the masses to achieve their fame. Throughout the country revolutionary youths are digging up these graves and tombs, denouncing the remains and then burning them. Destroying the space afterwards to ensure this false glorification of the past is removed. Of particular note is the raid on the Ming tombs where the remains of the Wanli Emperor and his empresses were similarly destroyed. Archaeological digs of grave sites are being immediately halted, archaeologists who refuse or complain of these actions are being detained."
 CulRevPurge.4.d:0 "Religion has long held the people of China from truly embracing the revolution and obeying its principles. Religion breeds superstition and removes the energy and resources of the people it tricks. Although Buddhist and Muslim religious sites are also major targets, the focus of the Red Guard and revolutionary youths has been sites of Confucian knowledge and historical significance. Across China Confucius temples are being besieged, including the Temple of Confucius in Shandong. Relics are being smashed while written works and collections, many priceless, are being torn up or burned by the revolutionaries. Confucian cemeteries and other sites are similarly being ransacked in order to purge China of its attachment to the reactionary old ways that hinder the embrace of continuous revolution."
 PLA_CulRev.1.d:0 "With the revolutionary fervor sweeping the nation and the activities of the Red Guards going unsupervised, there was a growing fear within the senior party leaders that the situation was escalating. Chairman Mao, sensing this and the growing dispute within the party over the radical revolutionaries and establishment party members wishing to maintain stability, asked the PLA under famed military leader Lin Biao to deploy and aid the left. Although this implied the PLA should support the radicals, this was not explicit and instead most PLA units began supporting the establishment party members. These units are actively curbing Red Guard excesses and ensuring the radical faction in certain areas does not gain access to heavy weaponry or overthrow the local party leaderships."
 = HyperCulRev.1.d:0 "As the Cultural Revolution in China rages, the conflict between the radical factions within the party against the more moderate, established party leadership shifted in favor of the radicals. Former Chinese President and at one time the second most powerful man in China, Liu Shaoqi was executed. Although he chaired the meeting that launched the Cultural Revolution, hoping to combat corruption and reform the country, Mao and his supporters quickly took control of it and orchestrated the downfall of Shaoqi and his arrest. He was being held in harsh conditions, but many in China expected he would simply be imprisoned. His execution for being a secret capitalist and traitor indicates the radicals are more firmly established and is a blow to those in the party hoping a future rehabilitation of Shaoqi could help move the country towards an end to the violence."
 HyperCulRev.2.d:0 "Deng Xiaoping, who helped oversee an economic reform campaign to mitigate Maoist economic damages, was executed by the government. This stunning news indicates that within the Chinese Communist Party leadership the radical Maoist are gaining prominence over the establishment party members. Prior to this announcement, Deng had not been formally arrested, though soon after the Cultural Revolution began, he was a target of the Red Guards. The Red Guards thought his economic reforms were capitalistic and opposed Mao. Unlike his political ally Liu Shaoqi, Deng was only purged of his national positions. However, he was very quickly tried, convicted, and then executed. Although some rumors speculate Deng had simply been executed by emotional Red Guards. Deng was still closely allied with some of the remaining establishment party members who are now looking at their future with grave concern following this latest announcement."
 HyperCulRev.5.d:0 "With the pre-Cultural Revolution leader Liu Shaoqi executed along with the young economic reformer Deng Xiaoping, the position of the establishment communist party members appeared numbered. Since the executions, few have spoken out or challenged the radical wing of the party from expanding the revolution. In the latest news, the Chinese Communist Party announced it was purging itself of conservatism and stated among the latest to be removed from the national government is famed statesman Zhou Enlai. Enlai has been a major part of the party since the 1930s and the face of the government abroad. He was also close with the executed Deng and it is believed if he tried to resist, he would have risked facing the same fate of Deng and being convicted as a partner to the traitor. There is now complete uncertainty over who or if anyone in the government is trying to mitigate or control the level of violence that appears to be escalating by the day."
 HyperCulRev.6.d:0 "The Last Emperor of China Puyi was killed by Red Guards who took him to the street, publicly humiliated him for his imperial past and then killed the elderly former ruler of Manchukuo. After the end of World War II, the Soviets held Puyi before transferring him to Chinese custody. The Chinese Communist Party sent him to a rehabilitation center where he was eventually rehabilitated and moved to Beijing. Although a strong supporter of communism and a spokesman for the regime, the Red Guards did not consider him reformed especially as his autobiography was published in foreign languages considered suspicious, English and French. Senior party leaders like Zhou Enlai had used their influence to protect Puyi, but with the latest purge of establishment party leaders, his protection ended, and he quickly fell to the Red Guard."
 PRC_Congress.1.d:0 "The Ninth Congress of the Communist Party of China successfully concluded recently. Lin Biao delivered the keynote address to cheering delegates who supported his praise of continuous revolution. The recent purges of former President Liu Shaoqi and his ally Deng Xiaoping was confirmed and approved, and delegates were elected. The radical wing of the party made substantial gains in terms of representatives, especially from the Red Guard, and had their main guiding principles, like continuous revolution enshrined in the constitution. However, Lin Biao ended up being the main winner as he was confirmed to be the successor of Mao and his supporters in the PLA also gained many seats. Many view these two developments as an indication that though the radicals remain powerful, they can still be checked and managed, especially by the PLA."
 PRC_Congress.2.d:0 "The Ninth Congress of the Communist Party of China concluded recently and its results are being received by cheering crowds across China. The Congress ratified continuous revolution and other principles of the Cultural Revolution as part of the constitution. In the address by Mao, he promised the Cultural Revolution will continue and called on all workers to expand the scope of it and deliver China from reactionary and counter-revolutionary forces. The Congress praised the swift justice in the recent executions of former President Liu Shaoqi and his ally Deng Xiaoping and confirmed the purging of Zhou Enlai as the correct course. The Congress will be dominated by representatives of the radical revolutionaries and the Red Guard. The recent sidelining of the PLA and the purge of the establishment wing of the party meant power now lies almost completely in the hands of party radicals."
 PRC_Congress.3.d:0 "The Ninth Congress of the Communist Party of China recently concluded. The Congress ratified and openly approved the reforms initiated by President Shaoqi. Shaoqi was praised for his wise leadership and mind for improving the lives of the people. Notably, the elections saw many reformers and Shaoqi supporters gain seats. Members of the old guard and the more devoted Maoist did not gain many seats following their recent purge. In addition, the military seats remained limited, also reflected the success of Shaoqi in controlling the institution. By the end of the party it was clear Shaoqi remains firmly in control and his reforms have become constitutionally ratified."
 BeijingSpring.1.d:0 "The failures of the Great Leap Forward along with efforts to end political isolation has led to a decline in the influence of Chinese Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong. Even within the higher echelons of the party his revolutionary rhetoric has lost its previous impact. Taking advantage of this, President Liu Shaoqi has emerged with a reformist vision for the country. He has already announced plans to roll back the more radical Maoist economic policies to help the economy recover. More significantly, he has opened the government up to public criticism in what is being called the Beijing Spring. Chinese citizens are allowed to critique what they do not like about the government, reflecting a liberalization of society. What this new openness will lead to remains to be seen."
 CulRevPurge.2.d:0 "Deng Xiaoping served as a political commissar during the Civil War and emerged as a promising rising star in the Chinese Communist Party. When the radical economic policies of Mao proved detrimental, he worked closely with President Liu Shaoqi to institute economic reforms that moderated the radical elements of the previous economic policies. However, with the Cultural Revolution and its resurgence of Mao, Deng was in a dangerous situation for being identified by the Red Guard as a critic of Mao. Following the arrest of Shaoqi, Deng faced more aggressive hostility and attacks by the Red Guard. The Red Guard also attacked his children and family. Finally, Deng was denounced and purged from his positions in the national government, though he was not arrested. Instead Deng will work as a factory worker away from central politics."
 CulRevPurge.3.d:0 "The former President of China, Liu Shaoqi was arrested today for being a secret capitalist working to betray the revolution and guide China towards a bourgeoise society. Shaoqi rose to prominence over an economic reform campaign which saw China mitigate the more radical economic theories of Mao. He also agreed with Mao over the need for a Cultural Revolution to root out corruption and end an overly centralized, bureaucratic structure. However, soon after he inaugurated the Cultural Revolution, the movement spiraled out of his control and power returned to Mao. Because of his previous criticism of Mao and his high standing in the party, Shaoqi was an early target of the radicals in the party who have grown powerful enough to imprison him."
 HyperCulRev.3.d:0 "The remote regions of Xinjiang and Tibet are not only physically far from the Chinese homeland but are also ideologically and culturally distant. The people there lack a revolutionary spirit and cling on to their traditional religious and cultural identities. In order to confront this, Mao has directed the Red Guard to enter those provinces and begin their continuous revolution. Religious sites and texts will be targeted. The wearing of cultural clothes and backwards practices will also be purged from these provinces. Any who resist will be arrested for reactionary thoughts. Soon, with the help of the Red Guard, these places will remove the shackles of their past and become a living organ of the revolution."
 HyperCulRev.4.d:0 "The Soviet Union abandoned its commitment to proper revolutionary Marxist-Leninism. This led to the Sino-Soviet Split and the Cultural Revolution is meant to ensure the revolutionary state never ceases. With our recent successes and expansion in efforts to implement continuous revolution, the Chines Communist Party announced plans to send representatives to several Eastern European communist states to promote our principles and support the anti-revisionist factions. The continued success of the Cultural Revolution continues to demonstrate that China is at the vanguard of revolutionary politics and must work to spread its message to workers across the world."
 BeijingSpring.5.d:0 "Mao Zedong and his supporters, despite their revolutionary zeal and great accomplishments in establishing the party in China, had unfortunately caused major economic hardship in recent years. Although their intentions were for the best, they had failed to anticipate the consequences of their actions. In addition, they are quite uncomfortable with the recent opening up of public discourse on the state. President Shaoqi has planned reforms and actions that will alleviate the hardship on the people and better connect them to the state, this Maoist old guard stands in the way. To resolve issue, Shaoqi announced the sacking of Maoists across the party in response to their previous failures and public criticisms. These officials will be stripped of their national appointments. Shaoqi made sure to ensure Mao himself is not being targeted or directly criticized during this purge."
 PRC_Japan.1.d:0 "In the 1930s the Sino-Japanese War brought untold hardship to the people of China, laying waste to cities and costing millions of lives due to violence and famine. The wounds of that and earlier conflicts have not healed. In recent weeks, across China, many have taken to the street to denounce Japan as an American puppet bent on overthrowing the revolution and unrepentant to its war crimes against the Chinese people. In accordance to the wishes of the people, President Shaoqi announced the deportation of all Japanese citizens from China, including those from the World War II Imperial Japanese Army who stayed after the war. Even if some of them helped our cause, it does not make up for the pain and suffering the people endured. Tokyo is said to be furious by our decision. China will also downgrade its diplomatic mission in Japan."
 BeijingSpring.2.d:0 "The Chinese Communist Party announced it has removed Jiang Qing, the wife of Mao Zedong, from her national party positions effective immediately. This purge emphasizes how much power President Shaoqi has accumulated recently at the expense of Mao and his political allies. Jiang, a former actress and arts director spearheaded a campaign of purging non-revolutionary art and media. She acts as the personal secretary of Mao and maintains strong ties with his closest political allies. The Party cited new evidence of her bourgeoise past that she had hidden from the party as the reason for her removal from politics."
 BeijingSpring.4.d:0 "Lin Biao is among the greatest military commanders in the PLA, having fought in all the PLA conflicts from 1925 to 1945. After the war ended he was promoted to Marshal and eventually joined the Politburo where he formed an alliance with Mao. He remains highly popular and respected within the PLA. For President Shaoqi this makes him a dangerous threat as the PLA could thwart his reforms and restore Maoists to power. To neutralize this threat, President Shaoqi had his political allies in the PLA claim Lin was seeking power for himself. With this accusation, the Marshal was removed from his political positions until a resolution to the accusations can be confirmed. The removal of Lin Biao will allow Shaoqi to put his supporters in the PLA to more senior posts and keep the PLA away from political power."
 BeijingSpring.6.d:0 "Deng Xiaoping recently helped publish a history of the early Chinese Communist Party by the Central Committee. The document is meant to preserve the legacy of Mao but also endorse the reforms being initiated by President Shaoqi. The history claims the accomplishments of Mao are immense, especially in the early decades of the party and in his military tactics. However, it notes mistakes were also made though they do not detract from his achievements. The document also blamed the close confidants of Mao for steering him wrong and blames them for the mistakes he made, basically absolving Mao of virtually any direct fault. Deng himself noted that Mao was Seven Parts Good, Three Parts Bad. This exemplifies the stance of the party that Mao is to be revered and respected, but that reforms and shifts away from his doctrine are perfectly acceptable."
