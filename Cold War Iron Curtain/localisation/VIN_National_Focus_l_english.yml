 Indochina_War.2.d:0 "The Battle of Route Coloniale 4 has ended up being a close success for France. Following the retreat of Groupement Bayards 3 500 French soldiers from their assault on Dông Khê, Colonel Chartons group attempted and succeeded to meet up with Groupement Bayard following the loss of personnel and heavy equipment to Viet Minh ambushes. The united group was pushed into the Coc Xa gorge, where they fought fiercely and defensively until French paratroopers could provide relief and repel the Viet Minh."
 Indochina_War.3.d:0 "The Battle of Route Coloniale 4 has proven a complete failure for France. Following the retreat of Groupement Bayards 3 500 French soldiers from their assault on Dông Khê, Colonel Chartons group attempted and succeeded to meet up with Groupement Bayard following the loss of personnel and heavy equipment to Viet Minh ambushes. The united group was pushed into the Coc Xa gorge, where they were slaughtered to the last man."
 Indochina_War.5.d:0 "The siege of the French outpost at Dông Khê broke earlier today following the intervention of the 1st Foreign Legion Parachute Battalion. After two days of brutal mortar bombardment and human wave attacks of up to two thousand Viet Minh, the Parachute Battalion provided necessary relief before the outpost broke. Further reinforcement by 5 000 Legionnaires and Moroccans has meant the full retreat of Viet Minh forces."
 Indochina_War.6.d:0 "The Viet Minh have won a series of deadly engagements over the French outpost in Dông Khê. After two days of brutal mortar bombardment and human wave attacks of up to two thousand Viet Minh, the two companies holding the outpost were forced to retreat with what little they had left. An attack by the "1st Foreign Legion Parachute Battalion was similarly counterattacked and pushed back. One final attack occurred more recently when 5 000 Legionnaires and Moroccans attempted to retake the outpost, and only 4 800 came back."
 Indochina_War.8.d:0 "The French have decisively won the battle of Vinh Yen. Although the French Foreign Legion faced several small defeats that allowed the Viet Minh to take a string of hills in front of Vinh Yen, the employment of artillery, heavy air support, and napalm bombs against the Viet Minh allowed the Foreign Legion to withdraw, regroup, and counterattack, with the French air support finally forcing a retreat of the guerilla forces."
 Indochina_War.9.d:0 "The Viet Minh have decisively won the battle of Vinh Yen. Though the French employed everything in their reserves - including artillery, heavy air support, and napalm bombs; the Viet Minh were able to demolish the Foreign Legion at every hill, even after a brief retreat. Undersupplied troops were killed to a man, and the Viet Minh have yet again proven that this will be a long war."
 Indochina_War.11.d:0 "The Viet Minh’s night strikes against the outposts at Mao Khe have been successfully repelled by the French Foreign Legion. The North Vietnamese guerillas began a full scale assault on the city three days after the initial assault, but stalled due to pressure from the French navy. A further assault on Mao Khe’s coal mine was similarly repelled due to French air support. One final artillery and infantry assault was attempted, and was pushed back with bloody close quarters fighting and French artillery strikes."
 Indochina_War.12.d:0 "The Viet Minh’s night strikes against the outposts at Mao Khe have successfully decimated the French Foreign Legion. The North Vietnamese guerillas began a full scale assault on the city three days after the initial assault, but stalled due to pressure from the French navy. A massive distractionary assault on Mao Khe’s coal mine was made to pull attention away from the city, and, while the French Foreign Legion was distracted, the Viet Minh made a final artillery and infantry assault, breaking the remaining defenders and taking the city before a proper response could be organised."
 Indochina_War.14.d:0 "After a long and drawn out battle, the French Far East Corps, under General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny, has beaten back the Vietnamese onslaught against them.One of the few conventional battles against the Viet Minh, General Tassigny has shown his knack for strategy, wit and cunning once again, by beating back the Viet Minh militia. Whilst losing his only son in the battle, the general is content with his win, while quietly mourning his son's death in the field.\n\n The Day River Delta is a strategically important region for France, as it is one of the only regions with a Catholic majority, therefore meaning a surprisingly large amount of Vietnamese people in the area favour the French. This victory has brought them happiness in knowing the Vietnamese have been beaten back. No one knows what the Viet Minh's next move will be, but many suspect it won't be in the Day River Delta region."
 Indochina_War.15.d:0 "The Viet Minh has declared victory over the French Far East Corps in a stunning display of tactics by Vietnamese General Võ Nguyên Giáp. The general easily outwitted French General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny by using non-conventional tactics against his French counterpart. An entire regimental combat team and a paratrooper battalion were wiped out in the surprise night attack, including General Tassigny and his son. While some units were able to rally, they were quickly driven back.\n\n It seems that the Day River Delta region shall become a Viet Minh stronghold, even if there is a Catholic majority. What this means for the French effort in Vietnam is not known, but what is known, is that France has lost one of their most finest generals."
 Indochina_War.17.d:0 "This morning the French government has triumphantly declared that the outpost at Dien Bien Phu has beaten back the attacking Viet Minh forces and are in a holding action against any more hostile insurgents. The French Far East Corps high command has stated, 'We have done what so many thought was not possible.'. With casualties in the tens of thousands, the Viet Minh has admitted, 'We  have lost this battle, and we show the enemy respect for their hard-fought win.'. They followed up that statement with another broadcast: 'The French imperialists shall regret ever coming to Vietnam! We shall fight them with a ferocity the likes of never seen before!'. Many observers say that the Viet Minh will most likely not follow through with their declaration."
 Indochina_War.18.d:0 "This morning the French government has confirmed the loss of the French military outpost at Dien Bien Phu to the Viet Minh two days ago. In the press release by the Viet Minh yesterday, the Vietnamese claimed that they had killed, wounded and captured over 20,000 17 tanks destroyed and captured, and over 100 aircraft. The French Far East Expeditionary Corp's high command denied those reports, saying it was only 16,000 men, 10 tanks and 67 aircraft. Nonetheless, it is still a huge defeat for France, and many speculate that they may have to go to the negotiation table in Geneva."
