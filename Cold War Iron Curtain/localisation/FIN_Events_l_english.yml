 fin.1.d:0 "For too long the workers at Kemi Oy Pajusaari have been striking. After Ministry of Social Affairs wage department wanted to lower the salery of the woodworkers by 30-40 percent, the workers decided to strike. Soon after the workers of Kemi Harbour and Kaarihaara Saw followed, including some local woodworkers resulting in thousends of workers striking. The situation started escalating when multiple parties attempted to end the strike in their favour. The struggle was mostly between Communist Party of Finland and the Prime Minister K-A Fagerholm's cabinet. The cabinet controlled a large part of the trade unions through the Social Democratic Party and the communists wanted to regain the power their parliamentary organization Finnish People's Democratic League had lost in the 1948 legislative election. Even the Soviets tried interfering, with the Soviet ambassador Grigori Savonenkov who voiced his support for the striking workers.\nAs the strikes went on, the government declared the strikes illegal. The strike caused a jam of 20,5 million cubic foot of logs to the mouth of Kemijoki river. The employers recruited strikebreakers, bringing them to work under police protection.\nAs the strikers went on a peaceful march of more the 3,000 strikers went on their way to the estuary, where the strikebreakers were driving logs and releasing the jam. As the march was stopped by armed policemen, a violent riot burst out. Protesters were equipped with sticks and rocks, while the police were using their batons and guns. One striker was shot and a female worker was fatally hit by a truck. It is still unclear who fired the deadly shot. According to official forensic examination the bullet was not shot from any of the police guns. One police officer stated he was prevented from shooting at a violent striker only by his gun jamming.\nAs a result, president Juho Kusti Paasikivi called a general alert of the armed forces and the government sent army troops to Kemi. This ended up with an arrest of 22 leading activists. A total number of 127 strikers were later accused of uprising, 63 of them were sent to prison. The police violence caused a series of sympathy strikes around Finland by communist dominated trade unions like the seamen's union led by Niilo Wälläri and a large number of metal workers.\nFinnish government was even afraid of communist uprising and Soviet intervention. Communists in turn, were accusing the government for violating the Paris Peace Treaty since they had sent military against the striking workers. The American press characterized the incident as a "test for Finnish democracy". Soviet newspaper Pravda was talking about "police terror" and "Prime Minister Fagerholm's collaboration with American imperialists". The sympathy strikes were finally put down several weeks later, as the Social Democrat controlled Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions expelled the striking unions. Several other unions decided to cancel their planned strikes. Some trade union leaders were later put on trial and given short sentences."
