Recently, troops from the Peoples’s Liberation Army have begun shelling the aforementioned islands; with Zhou Enlai claiming that Taiwan must be liberated from the oppressive forces of the Kuomintang that currently rule with an iron fist. The PLA also sent forces to seize the Yijiangshan Islands, located off the coast of Zhejiang."
 PRC_Focus_2_desc:0 "Following the Hundred Flowers Campaign, Mao Zedong was determined to root out “reactionary” elements from the nation, establishing a campaign to prosecute those that criticized the government of the PRC. Immediately after the end of the Hundred Flowers movement, Mao began to arrest intellectuals and critics; with the penalties of hard labor or execution in some cases, with the judicial power being replaced by political cadres and the police. It was soon seen that 300,000 people had been labeled as rightists – it was rumored that Deng Xiaoping was one of the most enthusiastic prosecutors of the movement during its wave of purges. The resentment against “rightists” goes as far back in the Communist Party as the Long March, exemplified as the hatred against Zhang Bojun."
 PRC_Focus_3_desc:0 "With the advent of the Hundred Flowers movement, which brought dozens of letters and outspoken protests in Maoist China, it did not take long for the ethnic and religious minorities all over China to follow the examples of the intellectuals to criticize their treatment in China by the authorities; along with criticisms to the CPC and Mao Zedong himself. The Helmsman soon answered with the purge of the intellectuals and along with them, the minorities. Being subject to torture, public humiliation and pressure, many of these cases were followed by suicide or executions, suffering a similar fate to the intellectuals that were crushed during the Anti-Rightist Campaign."
 PRC_Focus_4_desc:0 "Chairman Mao stated that “the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend is designed to promote the flourishing of the arts and the progress of science”. And it was with this idea that the PRC began the ‘Hundred Flowers Campaign’, being directed at encouraging the citizens of China to express openly their opinions, as the idea was to promote the intellectuals to discuss the country’s problems in order to promote new forms or arts and cultural institutions. It didn’t take long for protests to rise up against the CPC and for letters to flood Mao with criticism; just as it didn’t take long for Chairman Mao to being a prosecution campaign against those that were critical of the regime and its ideology and those that were targeted were publicly criticized and condemned to prison labor camps, China soon witnessed the creation of the Anti-Rightist Movement."
 PRC_Focus_5_desc:0 "In Manchuria, Mao has launched a campaign to get rid of corrupt or otherwise pro-Taiwan elements inside China, with a focus on former KMT members, bureaucratic officials who were not official party members and party members that were corrupt. The antis were the anti-corruption, anti-waste and anti-bureaucracy. The Three-Anti campaign dished out extremely harsh punishments, including torture and all found guilty of their confessed or unconfessed crimes had to pay fines to the government. The Helmsman of the nation has claimed time and time again that this is a major measure that is necessary to rid China of corrupt members and those that embezzle and stagnate the Chinese economy with “their own selfish gains”."
 PRC_Focus_6_desc:0 "With the Korean War, opportunities were given to many in Northern China, which gave the rise of a new class of capitalists in Manchuria, who soon started to realize that they were not seen with friendly eyes in Beijing. The Five-Anti Campaign was soon launched, described as an all-out war against the bourgeoisie in China, and the aforementioned antis were: Anti-bribery, anti-theft of state property, anti-tax evasion, anti-cheating on government contracts and anti-stealing state economic intelligence. Some companies started to send 1,000 confessions per day in order to rid themselves of the immense pressure that the CPC put in them; parades of anti-capitalists activists went door-to-door to visit business leaders, generating immense psychological pressure. Mao said that “we must probably execute 10,000 to several tens of thousands of embezzlers nationwide before we can solve the problem”. There were hundreds of thousands of suicides that were a direct result of this campaign; with Chinese capitalists receiving no better treatment than foreigners."
 PRC_Focus_7_desc:0 "As the Anti-Rightist Campaign goes underway, many intellectuals are being arrested, tortured or otherwise humiliated and jailed. Chen Fengxiao was jailed for 15 years during the Campaign for being a Rightist and thus, betraying the Maoist movement. Many dissidents were scorched by fire, beaten to death or executed by firing squad, and an estimated 400,000 to 700,000 people were politically prosecuted; the backbreaking labor in the prison system often led to their deaths and others were completely excluded from society, such as Luo Longji and Zhang Bojun, while others such as Chen Mengjia committed suicide due to the exclusion and political pressure."
 PRC_Focus_8_desc:0 "During the Anti-Rightist Campaign, in order to facilitate the prosecution of intellectuals and other dissenters of the Maoist government, legal scholars and workers were also prosecuted and sentenced to harsh jail sentences for collaborating or otherwise slowing down the Movement; the judicial system was scrutinized and watched carefully as it was slowly replaced by the Party cadres loyal to the CPC and Mao, and the police in order to facilitate the arrests and the dishing out of sentences. Those that weren’t arrested were transferred to other jobs that didn’t impede the takeover of the independent judiciary by the party, a move that, for many, signified that Mao was consolidating his power even further in China."
