Recently, troops from the Peoples’s Liberation Army have begun shelling the aforementioned islands; with Zhou Enlai claiming that Taiwan must be liberated from the oppressive forces of the Kuomintang that currently rule with an iron fist. The PLA also sent forces to seize the Yijiangshan Islands, located off the coast of Zhejiang."
 PRC_Focus_2_desc:0 "Following the Hundred Flowers Campaign, Mao Zedong was determined to root out “reactionary” elements from the nation, establishing a campaign to prosecute those that criticized the government of the PRC. Immediately after the end of the Hundred Flowers movement, Mao began to arrest intellectuals and critics; with the penalties of hard labor or execution in some cases, with the judicial power being replaced by political cadres and the police. It was soon seen that 300,000 people had been labeled as rightists – it was rumored that Deng Xiaoping was one of the most enthusiastic prosecutors of the movement during its wave of purges. The resentment against “rightists” goes as far back in the Communist Party as the Long March, exemplified as the hatred against Zhang Bojun."
 PRC_Focus_3_desc:0 "\nWith the advent of the Hundred Flowers movement, which brought dozens of letters and outspoken protests in Maoist China, it did not take long for the ethnic and religious minorities all over China to follow the examples of the intellectuals to criticize their treatment in China by the authorities; along with criticisms to the CPC and Mao Zedong himself. The Helmsman soon answered with the purge of the intellectuals and along with them, the minorities. Being subject to torture, public humiliation and pressure, many of these cases were followed by suicide or executions, suffering a similar fate to the intellectuals that were crushed during the Anti-Rightist Campaign."
 PRC_Focus_4_desc:0 "Chairman Mao stated that “the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend is designed to promote the flourishing of the arts and the progress of science”. And it was with this idea that the PRC began the ‘Hundred Flowers Campaign’, being directed at encouraging the citizens of China to express openly their opinions, as the idea was to promote the intellectuals to discuss the country’s problems in order to promote new forms or arts and cultural institutions. It didn’t take long for protests to rise up against the CPC and for letters to flood Mao with criticism; just as it didn’t take long for Chairman Mao to being a prosecution campaign against those that were critical of the regime and its ideology and those that were targeted were publicly criticized and condemned to prison labor camps, China soon witnessed the creation of the Anti-Rightist Movement."
 PRC_Focus_5_desc:0 "In Manchuria, Mao has launched a campaign to get rid of corrupt or otherwise pro-Taiwan elements inside China, with a focus on former KMT members, bureaucratic officials who were not official party members and party members that were corrupt. The antis were the anti-corruption, anti-waste and anti-bureaucracy. The Three-Anti campaign dished out extremely harsh punishments, including torture and all found guilty of their confessed or unconfessed crimes had to pay fines to the government. The Helmsman of the nation has claimed time and time again that this is a major measure that is necessary to rid China of corrupt members and those that embezzle and stagnate the Chinese economy with “their own selfish gains”."
 PRC_Focus_6_desc:0 "With the Korean War, opportunities were given to many in Northern China, which gave the rise of a new class of capitalists in Manchuria, who soon started to realize that they were not seen with friendly eyes in Beijing. The Five-Anti Campaign was soon launched, described as an all-out war against the bourgeoisie in China, and the aforementioned antis were: Anti-bribery, anti-theft of state property, anti-tax evasion, anti-cheating on government contracts and anti-stealing state economic intelligence. Some companies started to send 1,000 confessions per day in order to rid themselves of the immense pressure that the CPC put in them; parades of anti-capitalists activists went door-to-door to visit business leaders, generating immense psychological pressure. Mao said that “we must probably execute 10,000 to several tens of thousands of embezzlers nationwide before we can solve the problem”. There were hundreds of thousands of suicides that were a direct result of this campaign; with Chinese capitalists receiving no better treatment than foreigners."
 PRC_Focus_7_desc:0 "\nAs the Anti-Rightist Campaign goes underway, many intellectuals are being arrested, tortured or otherwise humiliated and jailed. Chen Fengxiao was jailed for 15 years during the Campaign for being a Rightist and thus, betraying the Maoist movement. Many dissidents were scorched by fire, beaten to death or executed by firing squad, and an estimated 400,000 to 700,000 people were politically prosecuted; the backbreaking labor in the prison system often led to their deaths and others were completely excluded from society, such as Luo Longji and Zhang Bojun, while others such as Chen Mengjia committed suicide due to the exclusion and political pressure."
 PRC_Focus_8_desc:0 "\nDuring the Anti-Rightist Campaign, in order to facilitate the prosecution of intellectuals and other dissenters of the Maoist government, legal scholars and workers were also prosecuted and sentenced to harsh jail sentences for collaborating or otherwise slowing down the Movement; the judicial system was scrutinized and watched carefully as it was slowly replaced by the Party cadres loyal to the CPC and Mao, and the police in order to facilitate the arrests and the dishing out of sentences. Those that weren’t arrested were transferred to other jobs that didn’t impede the takeover of the independent judiciary by the party, a move that, for many, signified that Mao was consolidating his power even further in China."
 PRC_Focus_9_desc:0 "Today it has been declared that the son of Mao Zedong, the Paramount Leader of China, has been killed-in-action by an airstrike; an experienced officer, the child of Mao fought in World War Two as an artillery officer against the Third Reich in Poland, being a volunteer of the Soviet Army. During the time of his death he was serving in the Chinese People’s Volunteer Army, as a secretary and Russian translator for PVA commander Peng Dehuai. He was stationed at a PVA headquarters, in caves near an old gold mining settlement; it appears that four American planes dropped napalm bombs in the area, one of which destroyed a makeshift building near the caves, killing Mao Anying and another officer. Chairman Mao is reportedly deeply grieving this loss but no comment from The Helmsman was given at any time."
 PRC_Focus_10_desc:0 "The Great Helmsman of the People’s Republic of China, revolutionary leader and political theorist Mao Zedong has died; suffering two heart attacks earlier in the year, a final heart attack finally struck the paramount leader down a few days later, just past midnight. The CPC has broadcasted a major radio message that announced the news of Mao’s passing, while clamoring for party unity. The leader has been embalmed and draped in a CPC flag, where it will be staying at the Great Hall of the People for one week. It is estimated that one million people will come to see the Helmsman one last time, while those that already are present for it, are openly crying or displaying some degree of sadness. Chairman Mao’s official portrait has been hung on the wall, with a banner reading “Carry on the cause left by Chairman Mao and carry on the cause of proletarian revolution to the end”."
 PRC_Focus_11_desc:0 "The Chinese government has sent troops to Chamdo in what they call a “Liberation of Tibet” after failed negotiations to incorporate Tibet into the nation; the People’s Liberation Army has marched over the Jinsha River with hundreds of troops which have seized the border town of Qamdo and active hostilities began in the border area northeast of the Gyamo Ngul Chu River and east of the 96th meridian. It is unclear whether the People’s Republic of China will immediately push forward their desire to annex Tibet but it does seem very likely, with Mao Zedong claiming that “the Tibetan people have suffered enough, it is finally time for them to join the People’s Republic of China and be liberated.”"
 PRC_Focus_12_desc:0 "\nAfter the fall of the army of the Ma Clique during the Chinese Civil War, an insurgency was established being led by former generals and veterans of Ma Bufang. The foundation of the insurgency was the fall of Ma Bufang during the Ningxia Campaign; and soon after, many generals, most of them Muslim, defected to the People’s Republic of China as the collapse of the Nationalist China was imminent. Most of the former Kuomintang Muslim Generals, such as Ma Bufang, Ma Hongkui, Ma Dunjing, Bai Chongxi and etcetera all fled to Taiwan along with the Government of the Republic of China but Ma Bufang’s subordinate officers remained behind in the province of Qinghai. Today, the last of the insurgents were crushed in Yiwu, where over 700 insurgents perished in battle as the flag of the PRC flew over the town of Yiwu."
 PRC_Focus_13_desc:0 "The PLA has announced today that it has ended the Tibetan Insurgency. As Lhasa openly rebelled against the People’s Republic of China, the army shelled Norbulingka in order to disperse the crowd, placing troops in barricades that divided the city into a northern and southern part. Early in the morning the Tibetan rebels suffered a defeat against the troops of the People’s Liberation Army, who fought a bloody battle in the streets before marching towards Jokhang, fighting a three hours-long battle, moments later the flag of China had been raised on the temple, which crushed the uprising. There are multiple rumors that Pandatsang Rapga, a pro-KMT and pro-ROC revolutionary leader was instrumental in the revolt against the PRC; and the Dalai Lama is nowhere to be found."
 PRC_Focus_14_desc:0 "Chairman Mao has declared that, along with the measures being taken to ensure that the Great Leap Forward takes place, a new Campaign is being approved to be executed immediately called the “Four Pests Campaign”. The Chairman claims that this is a hygiene campaign against rats, flies, mosquitoes and sparrows; the mosquito being responsible for malaria; the rodents that spread the plague; the flies which are considered pervasive and the sparrows, which are eating the grains and seeds of the bountiful harvests in China. Contests are also being held among enterprises, government agencies and schools in cleanliness, it is reported that non-material rewards are being given to those that are handing in the most amount of rat tails, dead flies and mosquitos or dead sparrows."
